Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

Overview 2 Overview The machinery directive stipulates that documentation must be supplied with every machine, and the product safety act also requires operating instructions for products sold. Due to these legal requirements, the documentation of machines and products is necessary for every company today. The documentation costs time, must be consistent and should always look the same, even if several people are working on it. Twin CAT Documentation Generation enables the creation of documentation within a machine application or PLC library. To do this, the program uses specific markups within the source code comments to highlight relevant information and format it for documentation. Reference to other documents containing additional information is also possible. Since the documentation is generated directly from the programming, it can be ensured that the application program and the documentation are consistent. Moreover, the additional effort for developers is moderate because the documentation generation is based on markups. Developers can contribute content to the documentation in Twin CAT Documentation Generation without being familiar with the typical authoring tools. 8 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030

Basic principles 4 Basic principles With special comments, the developer writing a program with Twin CAT 3 is able to write explanatory text directly into the Twin CAT project. By using special markups in the comments, the text can be evaluated automatically. In addition, the structure of the software is also used to show inheritance relationships and dependencies. A table of contents for the documentation is generated automatically. No further markups are required for this. Twin CAT Documentation Generation uses markups to process documentation comments in your code and formats them into documentation whose name and location you specify in the TE1030-Tc3Doc Gen window. As output format you can select HTML, among others. Documentation Generation also automatically generates partial class diagrams to show the dependencies of code elements. The automatic generation of a documentation is based on the following information within a Twin CAT project: • Structural information • Information marked up in the source code comment (markups) • Libraries used Elements hierarchy The Description, Summary and Example markups are at the top of the elements hierarchy. These three markups are the prerequisite for using many other markups. The following example shows how to embed the markup code into the higher-level markup description: (*!<description>Now follows a code block. <code> i Count:=i Count+1 </code> </description>*) In the generated documentation it looks like this: The documentation is automatically divided into individual sections during output, which also reflects this hierarchy: • Overview ◦ Is generated automatically and also contains the table of contents. • Summary • Description • Declaration • Example Output formats Twin CAT 3 Documentation Generation allows you to create your documentation in three different output formats: • HTML • PDF • MSHC The integration in Twin CAT is structured accordingly as follows: 10 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030

Markups 7 Markups The following chapter is about the markups that are used to create the documentation. The markups used for documentation creation are XML-based. Example //!<description> This is a description. </description> Abbreviated forms of the tags If a documentation element has only the length of one line, the abbreviated form can be used. In this form, the XML tags are written without square brackets and closing elements. Instead of brackets, a leading @ is used to mark the tags. Example Normal form: //!<summary> Summary by using normal form </summary> Abbreviated form: //!@summary Summary by using the abbreviated form 7.1 Overview Below you will find an overview of the markups that are needed for documentation creation. 16 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030

## Page 17

Markups Normal form Abbreviated form Context Description <description> </ @description Text section marked as description> description. <summary> </summary> @summary Text section marked as summary. <example> </example> @example Text section formatted as an example. <h1> </h1> - <h6> </h6> - description, summary, Headings up to level 6 example <code> </code> @code description, summary, Section with source code example <literal> </literal> @literal description, summary, Plain text that is not to be example interpreted. - $crossreference description, summary, Cross-reference example <see uri=“”> </see> @see description, summary, Link within a section of example text <seealso uri=“”> </ @seealso description, summary, Link outside any text seealso> example section <param name=“”> </ @param Parameter value param> <ul> </ul> @ul description, summary, Defines an unordered list. example <ol> </ol> @ol description, summary, Defines a numbered list. example <li> </li> - description, summary, Element of a list example <table> </table> - description, summary, Defines a table similar to example HTML. <th> </th> - description, summary, Creates a table with example header. <tr> </tr> - description, summary, Creates a table row. example <td> </td> - description, summary, Creates a table column. example <audience> </audience> - Defines a user group for the selected text section. <preliminary></ @preliminary Marks a section as preliminary> needing to be changed. <note type=“”> </note> - description, summary, Defines safety instructions example (Danger, Warning, Note). <image uri=""></image> - description, summary, Includes an image. example 7.2 Delimiters To generate the documentation, delimiters must be inserted in the comments. These delimiters work in combination with the markups. For examples of how to use the delimiters, see the examples for each markup. The following delimiters are allowed: //! Single-line documentation comment (*! …*) Multi-line documentation comment TE1030 Version: 1.3.2 17

## Page 18

Markups 7.3 Markup descriptions The individual markups are described in more detail below and there are examples of the written-out normal form and the abbreviated form in each case. 7.3.1 Description This markup element is used to mark a text block as a description. Description blocks can be created in various places in the code. In the documentation generated, the individual description blocks are then combined into one text block. So the documentation can be written at the places of the PLC code where it fits and does not have to be at the beginning or end. The markup description additionally serves as a @mantel element and is accordingly required to be able to use various other elements for the documentation. Other markups can also be used in the abbreviated form of the Description markup. Example Normal form: Single-line comment: //!<description> Text block that will be marked as description. </description> Multi-line comment: (*!<description>This is a description. <returns> A return value is named here. </returns> </description>*) Abbreviated form: //!@description This could be a description of a code element. 7.3.2 Summary This markup element can be used to mark a text as a summary of a code element. Within the summary you are allowed to use additional markups. In contrast to the description, however, the summary only exists once per program organization unit. All other places where you use the markup are not output in the documentation. Therefore, write the summary as a coherent text block. Example Normal form: //!<summary> This is the summary of the description in normal form. </summary> Abbreviated form: //!@summary This is the summary of the description in the abbreviated form. 7.3.3 Example The Example markup can be used to mark a text block as an example. Examples can be written in various places in the code. In the generated documentation, the examples are then displayed one below the other under the heading Example. Thus, the examples can be written at the places in the code where they make sense and do not have to be contiguous at the beginning or end. Additional markups may be used within Examples. There is no abbreviated form for this markup. 18 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030

## Page 19

Markups Example Normal form: (*!<example>This is the description of the following example: <code>i Count:=i Count+1;</code> This example shows the increase of the $i Count variable by 1.</example>*) 7.3.4 Header This markup element can be used to format a heading. You can structure your content with the headings up to the sixth level. To do this, count up the outline number of the markup to "6" accordingly. The heading markup can be used individually and does not need to be included in any other markup. Besides, you can use it in any place of your documentation. Example <h1>This is a first level heading</h1> <h2>This is a second level heading</h2> 7.3.5 List These markers can be used to define a list. The following list types are available: unordered list <ul> or ordered list <ol>. Similar to HTML, the markup list elements <li> are used for the elements of both lists. Unordered and ordered lists must be embedded in a Description, Summary or Example. Example Normal form: (*!<description> The following is a list <ul> <li> Content of element 1 </li> <li> List item </li> <li> List item </li> </ul> </description>*) Abbreviated form: //!@description @ul <li> list item</li> <li> list item</li> <li> list item</li> 7.3.6 Table This markup defines a table. No abbreviated form is available for a table. You must embed tables in the Description, Summary or Example markups. The tags define the appearance of the table. The <tr> tag creates a table row. The <td> tag creates a table column. Example Normal form: (*!<description> <table> TE1030 Version: 1.3.2 19

## Page 20

Markups <tr> <td> Contents of cell 1 </td> <td> Contents of cell 2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Contents of cell 3 </td> <td> Contents of cell 4 </td> </tr> </table> </description>*) Create table with header row You also have the option to create the table with header row. To do this, use the <th> markup instead of <td>. Example (*!<description> <table> <tr> <th> Header cell 1 </th> <th> Header cell 2 </th> </tr> ><tr> <td> Contents of cell 1 </td> <td> Contents of cell 2 </td> </tr> </table> </description>*) 7.3.7 Cross references To create a reference to another element within the documentation, use the "$" character. If the reference target is not within the same code element, a qualified name, i.e. a full domain name, must be used. Twin CAT Documentation Generation automatically searches for this element and creates a hyperlink in the documentation. You use the cross-reference within the Description, Summary and Example markups. Example Normal form: //!<description> You can find an example in $Codeblock </description> Abbreviated form: //!@description You can find an example in $Codeblock 20 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030

## Page 21

Markups 7.3.8 Links Within your documentation you can link to external addresses. The target of the link is specified by using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). The URI must be enclosed in normal quotes so that the XML library can process the string correctly. You must always insert links within a Description, Summary or Example. You can either insert links in the same line of text or place a line break before the link. To do this, use the "see" and "seealso" markups. See Use the <see> markup to create a link within a line of text. Example Normal form: (*!<description> You can find more information on our homepage <see uri="http://www.beckhoff.de/TE1030"> Beckhoff Homepage </see> </description>*) Abbreviated form: //!@description You can find more information on our homepage @see uri=http://www.beckhoff.de/TE1030 Beckhoff Homepage In the documentation it looks like this: Seealso Use the <seealso> markup to create a line break before a link, placing the link in a new text section. Example Normal form: //!<description> You can find more information on our homepage <seealso uri="http://www.beckhoff.de/ TE1030"> Beckhoff Homepage </seealso> </description> Abbreviated form: //! @description You can find more information on our homepage @seealso http://www.beckhoff.de/TE1030 In the documentation it looks like this: 7.3.9 Code The <code> markup can be used to mark a text block as source code. This markup must always be embedded in a Description, Summary or Example. Example Normal form: (*!<description>Now follows a code block. <code> i Count:=i Count+1 </code> TE1030 Version: 1.3.2 21

## Page 22

Markups </description>*) Abbreviated form: (*!<description>Now follows a code block. @code i Count:=i Count+1; </description>*) 7.3.10 Literal The <literal> markup can be used to indicate text as plain text that should not be interpreted. This function can be useful to make annotations within the source code of the documentation. Use Literal within the markups Descriptions, Summaries and Examples. Example Normal form: //!<description> This description contains text that should not be interpreted. As follows. <literal> The <b> bold </b> tag is not interpreted here, but the tags are written to the documentation. </literal> Here follows text again in which the <b> bold </b> marking is interpreted. </description> Abbreviated form: //@description This description contains text that should not be interpreted. As follows. @literal The <b> bold </b> tag is not interpreted here, but the tags are written to the documentation. 7.3.11 Preliminary Allows you to specify whether a section or element is provisional and subject to change. This markup element is only an identifier and cannot contain any other internal information. Preliminary must be included in a Description, Summary or Example. Example Normal form: (*!<description>Now follows a preliminary text section. <preliminary> Preliminary </preliminary> </description>*) Abbreviated form: //!@description @preliminary Preliminary 7.3.12 Audience With this markup you can define that parts of the documentation are generated only for a defined user group. The markup must be included in a Description, Summary or Example. The desired target group must be defined in two places. On the one hand, it must be set during the configuration of the documentation. 1. To do this, select either "general" or "internal" from the drop-down menu Audience. 22 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030

## Page 23

Markups On the other hand, the target group must be specified as "audience type" within the markup. Example Normal form: (*!<description>This is a normal part of the documentation. <audience type="internal">This part is displayed for internal use only. </audience></ description>*) If the target group has been set in both places, the documentation will be output accordingly. Currently, the two target groups "general" and "internal" are available. If you set the target group to "internal", the text within the markup will not be output to the documentation. 7.3.13 Param The markup Param allows to describe a parameter value of e.g. variable declarations. It can be used optionally if there is not enough space behind the parameter definition in the declaration editor, or to have the complete documentation in the same place. The Param stands alone and does not need to be included in a Description, Summary or Example. The markup Param allows you to create a table in which the variables and their values are listed. Example Normal form: //!<param name="f Float Var">Some float var</param> //!<param name="i Count2">Some count var</param> PROGRAM MAIN VAR_OUTPUT f Float Var : REAL; i Count2 :INT; END_VAR Abbreviated form: TE1030 Version: 1.3.2 23

## Page 24

Markups //!@param f Float Var Some float var //!@param i Count2 Some count var In the documentation it looks like this: 7.3.14 Note You use the markup Note to define a note. You must embed the entire markup in either a Description, Summary, or Example. There is no abbreviated form for the markup Note. A note can be of the Information, Warning or Danger type. You define the type of the note within the markup as "Note Type" with a signal word. The signal word is then highlighted in color according to the danger level. Possible types that you can define: <note type="hazard"> - Hazard <note type="warning"> - Warning <note type="information"> - Information Example Normal form: //!<description> <note type="warning">Serious injuries are possible.</note> </description> 7.3.15 Image With the help of the markup Image, which has to be inserted into a Description, Summary or Example, you can include images in your documentation. To include images, create a folder called "Images" in the folder of the PLC project. The folder "Images" may have subfolders to structure the images. All references to the images are then made within this folder, i.e. "Subfolder/Image Name". Place the images in the PLC project folder as follows: 24 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030

## Page 25

Markups 1. Create a new folder below your PLC project. TE1030 Version: 1.3.2 25

## Page 26

Markups 2. Name the folder "Images". 3. Drag and drop all the images you want to use into the folder. ð You can now use the stored images in your documentation. Include the images in the documentation as follows: 1. Include the markup Image in either the Description, Summary, or Example markup. 2. Inside the markup, specify the name of the image. ð The image is output to the documentation. For the image to be found, the image name must match. • Be sure to write the name of the image correctly in the markup. Example (*!<description>This is a description with picture. <image uri="Sample Picture.png">Replacement text</image></description>*) Alternatively, you can include the images in the documentation using the absolute storage path. (*!<description> This is a description with picture. <image uri="C:/TE1030 PLC/IMAGES/test.jpg">Replacement text</image> </description>*) 26 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030

## Page 27

Markups If the image cannot be displayed, a replacement text that you create is generated in the documentation instead. Scale image size The included images can be scaled using the "width" and "height" markups. Normal form: (*!<description>This is a description with picture. <image uri="test.jpg">image title width="10" height="20" </image></description>*) 7.3.16 Character formats You can use different character formats for your documentation. These are based on the HTML convention in Twin CAT Documentation Generation. Bold You have the option to mark individual expressions in a text in bold. This works by using the <b> markup. Example: (*!<description> In the following description, a word is <b>bold</b>. </description>*) Italic You have the option to mark individual expressions in a text in italics. This works by using the <i> markup. Example: (*!<description> In the following description, a word is written in <i>italics</i>. </description>*) Code You have the possibility to mark single variable expressions in a text as code. This works by using the <c> markup. Example: (*!<description> The variable <c>i Count</c> is now formatted together with this text block. <code>i Count:=i Count+1;</code> </description>*) Underlined You have the option to underline individual expressions in a text. This works by using the <u> markup. Example: (*!<description> In the following description, a word is <u>underlined</u>. </description>*) TE1030 Version: 1.3.2 27

Formatting the documentation 9 Formatting the documentation The basic output format for the generated documentation is HTML. For formatting HTML files, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has provided CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a style sheet language that separates the display specifications from the content. When generating the documentation, you can specify how the generated documentation should be formatted by selecting a CSS file (see CSS template [} 32] selection box). The advantage of this approach is that you can create the documentation in the PLC code without formatting instructions. For formatting, you provide one or more CSS files that adapt the generated documentation accordingly without having to make any changes to the documentation. After installing the workload TE1030 | Twin CAT 3 Documentation Generation, there are two sample templates for CSS files in the folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Beckhoff\Twin CAT\3.1\Components\Tc Doc Gen\Templates\CSS . You can expand or modify these according to your needs. The modified or newly created templates must be available again in this folder in order to be used. There are two ways to make the templates available in this folder: 1. You can manually copy the changed or new templates to the folder. 2. You can use the ... button behind the CSS templates to open a selection window and select the templates. They will be automatically copied to the folder. 30 Version: 1.3.2 TE1030
