Introduction 1 Introduction This document describes the structure of the CNC error messages and provides an overview of all possible error messages. 1.1 Structure of a CNC error message Each CNC error message contains a unique error number and other information that describes the cause of the error as accurately as possible. Also, the error message contains identifiers of the minimum error response that the CNC will internally perform immediately after the error occurs. For easier diagnosis, the error messages are classified with regard to the cause of the error. Each corresponding error type receives a unique identifier and a data packet, which is always provided with this error type. These data packets (error roots) are described in the chapter entitled Error Types. They also include up to nine further parameters that contain additional information and, if applicable, provide limit values or incorrect internal control system values for display. 1.2 Overview of error reaction classes Each CNC error message is assigned to an error response class. This error response describes the internal, prompt reaction of the CNC to the error and initiates minimal measures to achieve a safe state from the CNC's point of view. Error internal error reaction Example(s) reaction class 1 No reaction Programmed feed rate not reached (BAVO). Only possible in the event of a warning (error class 1) 2 NC program execution aborted and Syntax error in the NC program (DECODER) transition to error state Geometry error in block processing (TRC) If an error occurs in the NC block preparation Software limit switch error in block processing area, the interpolator executes the NC blocks (BAVO) that have already been prepared. In this case, the time between the occurrence of the error and machine standstill depends on the type and number of buffered NC blocks. The BF reporting the error assumes an error state. 3 Job execution aborted and transition to Invalid axis requested in the case of BF AXIS normal state ADMINISTRATION After an error message, BFs that provide Unknown handwheel activated in MANUAL services for other BFs (servers), for example MODE. AXIS ADMINISTRATION, FILE ADMINISTRATION, MANUAL MODE, etc., abort job execution and return to normal state. 4 Motion stopped (feedhold) for the entire Measure: axis group and transition to error state. Probe already actuated. 5 Abrupt axis stop for defective axis, Due to the position lag of an axis, the interpolator feedhold for the other axes in the axis reacts with an axis stop for the axes in its axis group and transition to an error state group (PATH AXES). 6 Abrupt axis stop for all axes and transition Unknown state in the to an error state INTERPOLATOR or POSITION CONTROLLER Position control assumes an error state. 10 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Introduction 1.3 Overview of troubleshooting classes In a standardised form, the troubleshooting class describes the measures for remedying an error. NOTICE Difference between troubleshooting and error-free state In this connection, remedying an error does not mean that the cause of the problem is remedied, but that the CNC can be set to an error-free state. Troublesh Internal troubleshooting ooting Simulation Normal mode class 0 Error message acts as warning; this causes Error message acts as warning; this causes automatically one internal automatically one internal troubleshooting troubleshooting 2 Program processing continued can call an Requires complete reset of the NC channel implicitly called subroutine at program end. 5 Requires complete reset of the NC channel Requires complete reset of the NC channel 6 Requires restart of the CNC kernel Requires restart of the CNC kernel 7 Requires restart of the entire CNC kernel Requires restart of the entire CNC kernel after after switch-off switch-off NOTICE If an error of error class 7 occurs, please contact the support of your control manufacturer. They will need the complete error message with the error number and all further message parameters. 1.3.1 Overview of possible error types An error type classifies the information that is provided to the operator with the error message. The more extensive this additional information is, the easier it becomes to recognise the cause of the error on the basis of the error pattern. Error messages generated due to errors in the NC program contain the NC block number, the file names and the current offset. This makes it possible for an operator to visualise the NC line con- taining the error. 12 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

ID 20351 No primary motion block for chamfer/rounding contouring available. 246 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual
## Page 247

Overview of CNC error messages Description Chamfers (G301) or radii (G302) can only be inserted between motion blocks of group G00, G01, G02, G03. Therefore, a preceding motion block must be programmed before G301/G302. Example: Wrong: N10 G301 I20 N20 G01 X100 Y100 F10000 : N1000 M30 Correct: N10 G00 X0 Y0 Z0 N20 G01 X100 F10000 N30 G301 I20 N40 G01 Y100 F10000 : N1000 M30 Response Class 1 Continue NC program processing. Solution Class 1 Check and modify NC program. G301/G302 must always be programmed between 2 motion blocks. Error type 1, Error message from NC program. ID 20352 Internal buffers should be cleared although chamfer/rounding contouring is active. Description Certain NC commands (e.g. #FLUSH) cause a so-called “flushing” of the NC channel, i.e. internal buffers of the NC channel are enabled. This results in a conflict if the contouring G301/G302 function is enabled at this time since this is exactly where the buffer contents are required. In this case no additional motion block is inserted. Example: Wrong: N10 G00 X0 Y0 Z0 N20 G01 X50 F10000 N30 G301 I20 N40 #FLUSH N50 X100 Y100 : N1000 M30 Correct: N10 G00 X0 Y0 Z0 N20 G01 X50 F10000 N30 G301 I20 N40 X100 Y100 N50 #FLUSH : N1000 M30 Response Class 1 Continue NC program processing. Solution Class 1 Check and modify NC program. NC commands that shorten a so-called flushing of the NC channel may not be programmed within a contouring sequence, only before or behind it.

Overview of CNC error messages ID 40032 Axis is not configured to be used as motion axis. Description During the initialisation phase of the Motion Control Platform, it is checked whether an axis reference refers to an axis that can be assigned "single axis" and "multiple axes" functions by function blocks. The check happens in the initialization phase of the FB MCV_P1_Platform and is executed by the utility FB MCV_Axis Init. If this is not the case, this error is entered in the axis reference. Every FB that commands an axis by means of this reference detects the error and displays it at its error output. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Please check the following options: Was the correct axis reference used? Otherwise connect another axis reference to the input “Axis”. If yes, check the axis configuration in the axis configuration list. See P- AXIS-00015, P-AXIS-00018, P-AXIS-00250. Error type - ID 40033 Registering at HLI control units failed. Description During the initialisation phase, the PLC logs on to certain control units that are required for the function of the motion libraries. This occurs in all axis-specific HLI areas that can be addressed using a valid axis reference. The check happens during the initialization phase of the FB MCV_P1_Platform and is executed by the utility FB Ax_HLI_Init. If this does not succeed, this incorrect value is stored in the respective axis reference. Each FB that wants to transmit a job to the Motion Controller with this axis reference detects this error in the axis reference, and displays it at its error output. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Please contact your motion controller supplier. Error type - ID 40034 MC is not yet in cyclic operating state. Description A PLC application that uses PLC libraries containing function blocks according to the PLCopen specifications to solve function blocks must call exactly one instance of the MCV_Platform Base function block. During the initialisation phase of the Motion Control Platform, the utility FB MCV_Init Platform is called within the utility FB MCV_Platform Base. This checks whether the motion controller reports that it is running and if this is fulfilled, whether the motion controller performs its calculations cyclically. If it cannot be determined within a defined number of PLC cycles that the Motion Controller itself is in cyclic operation, this error message is transmitted to the calling FB MCV_Platform Base, which makes it available to the PLC application at its "Error ID" output. Response Class - The FB MCV_Platform Base sets its output “Error” to TRUE and the output “Done” to FALSE. Solution Class - Please contact the controller supplier and quote the error number.

Overview of CNC error messages ID 40035 MC hasn't finished the start-up phase already. Description When the Motion Controller reports to the HLI interface that it has completed its startup phase and is ready to receive jobs and move axes, it reports this via the HLI interface by setting gp Pform^.hochlauf_quit_r to TRUE in the platform-specific area of the HLI. No job can be sent via the HLI to the Motion Controller if this data item is FALSE. Response Class - No jobs are sent to the motion controller. Solution Class - Is the function block that displays that error message a MCV_Platform Base, this must be called further until the error message is no longer displayed. If that doesn't happen please contact the supplier of the control system. other function block, the job has to be sent again, because the former sent job wasn't sent to the motion controller. Error type - ID 40037 Pointer to platform specific HLI section is 0. Description A function block, that exchanges data and jobs with the motion controller via the platform-specific area on the HLI interface, checks whether the global pointer gp Pform contains a valid address before accessing this area. If the global pointer gp Pform contains an invalid address, such a function block displays this error message. Response Class - No data or jobs are exchanged via the interface HLI. Solution Class - Check whether the function module was commanded before the instance of the function block MCV_Hli Interface signalled that the interface HLI was successfully checked and is now ready to exchange data and jobs. If this is the case, implement the PLC application so that the function block is not called until the function block MCV_Hli Interface at output "Initialized" shows TRUE. Error type - ID 40038 Axis reference: addresses a HLI section that exceeds HLI definition. Description A function block displays this error code at its output "Error ID" if the axis reference that is assigned to an input of type AXIS_REF, i.e. inputs with the name "Axis", "Master" or "Slave", refers to an axis-specific HLI area that lies outside the specification of the motion controller. The error code is not only displayed if the FB is triggered at its input “Execute but also when the FB is called. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. The output “Error” is set to TRUE. 720 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class - There are 2 possible reasons why the error code is displayed: The PLC application overwrites the value specified in the axis reference during the initialisation phase of the motion environment, which is the reference to an axis-specific area of the HLI. Therefore, it must therefore be checked whether the structure element hli_axis_idx is overwritten in the global variable g_array_axis_ref[idx], which is assigned to an input of the FB of type AXIS_REF. The value of hli_axis_idx must be in the range [0 .. HLI_SYS_AX_MAXIDX]. The FB is called without checking if the instance of the FB MCV_Platform Base displays the value TRUE at the output "Done". Then move the FB to a PLC application area that is only processed when the instance of the FB type MCV_Platform Base indicates that the motion platform was successfully initialised. If none of the two cases described apply, please contact your motion controller supplier and quote the error code. Error type - ID 40039 Axis reference: addressed HLI section doesn't exist. Description A function block notifies this error code at its output “Error ID”, if an axis reference that is assigned to an input of type AXIS_REF, means at an input named by identifier “Axis”, “Master” or “Slave”points to an axis specific area that haven’t an axis assigned by the start-up list of the motion controller. The error code isn’t displayed only if the FB is triggered at his input „Execute“, but also at the moment the FB is calculated. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. The output “Error” is set to TRUE. Solution Class - There are 2 matters possible why the error code is notified: In fact, the controller startup list contains no entry for the axis. In the start-up list for the axis, make an entry for P-STUP-00015 and then adjust P-STUP-00014 accordingly. The order of axes in the startup list reflects the order of axis-specific HLI areas. Check whether the axis list specified in parameter P-STUP-00015 exists. If this is not the case, create the axle list. The PLC application overwrites the value specified in the axis reference during the initialization phase of the motion environment, which is the reference to an axis-specific area of the HLI. Therefore, it must therefore be checked whether the structure element hli_axis_idx is overwritten in the global variable g_array_axis_ref[idx], which is assigned to an input of the FB of type AXIS_REF. The value of hli_axis_idx has to be in range [0 .. g Nr Ax (number of all configured axes in the motion system)].

Overview of CNC error messages Description A function block displays this error code at its output "Error ID" if the axis group reference that is assigned at an input of type AXES_GROUP_REF with the name "Axis Group" refers to a channel-specific HLI area that lies outside the specification of the motion controller. The error code is not only displayed if the FB is triggered at its input “Execute but also when the FB is called. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. The output “Error” is set to TRUE. Solution Class - There are 2 possible reasons why the error code is displayed: The PLC application overwrites the value specified in the axis group reference during the initialization phase of the motion environment, which is the reference to a channel-specific area of the HLI. Therefore, it must be checked whether the structure element Hli Ifc Idx is overwritten in the global variable g Axes Group Ref[idx] which is assigned to an input of the FB of type AXES_GROUP_REF. The value of hli_axis_idx must be in the range [0 .. HLI_SYS_CH_MAXIDX]. The FB is called without checking if the instance of the FB MCV_Platform Base displays the value TRUE at the output "Done". Then move the FB to a PLC application area that is only processed when the instance of the FB type MCV_Platform Base indicates that the motion platform was successfully initialised. If none of the two cases described apply, please contact your motion controller supplier and quote the error code. Error type - ID 40041 Axis group reference: addressed HLI section doesn't exist. Description A function block displays this error code at its output "Error ID", if the axis group reference that is assigned at an input of type AXES_GROUP_REF with the name "Axes Group", refers to a channel-specific HLI area to which no channel has been assigned in the motion controller start-up list. The error code isn’t displayed only if the FB is triggered at his input „Execute“, but also at the moment the FB is calculated. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. The output “Error” is set to TRUE. Solution Class - There are 2 matters possible why the error code is notified: 1. In fact, the controller startup list contains no entry for the channel. In the start-up list for the channel, make an entry for P-STUP-00009 and then adjust P-STUP-00001 and P-STUP-00007 accordingly. The order of channels in the startup list reflects the order of channel-spe- cific HLI areas. Check whether the channel list specified for para- meter P-STUP-00009 exists. If this is not the case, create the chan- nel list. 2. The PLC application overwrites the value specified in the axis group reference during the initialization phase of the motion environment, which is the reference to a channel-specific area of the HLI. There- fore, it must be checked whether the structure element Hli Ifc Idx is overwritten in the global variable g Axes Group Ref[idx], which is as- signed to an input of the FB of type AXES_GROUP_REF. The value of hli_axis_idx must be in range [0 .. g Nr Ch (number of all configured channels in the motion system)]. 722 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

## Page 725

Overview of CNC error messages Description In the HLI interface, there are areas for various user interface elements (HMI) through which the properties of these elements can be influenced. Each of these areas is created as an array and there is one for each element type. The elements include keys (Key), parameters (Param) or strings (String). If one of the function blocks listed in the table below accesses the corresponding array with an invalid index ("Idx” input), the error is displayed at its "Error ID" output. The permissible index values are dependent on the function block type and are listed in the table below. The upper limit values are defined in the HLI library [HLI]. Function block data type HLI HMI: addresses a HLI section that exceeds HLI definition. MCV_Ax Plc Key 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPK_AXIS_MAXIDX MCV_Ax Plc Param 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPP_AXIS_MAXIDX MCV_Ax Plc String 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPS_AXIS_MAXIDX MCV_Ch Plc Key 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPK_CHAN_MAXIDX MCV_Ch Plc Param 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPP_CHAN_MAXIDX MCV_Ch Plc String 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPS_CHAN_MAXIDX MCV_Glob Plc Key 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPK_GLOB_MAXIDX MCV_Glob Plc Param 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPP_GLOB_MAXIDX MCV_Glob Plc String 0 <= Idx <= HLI_HPS_GLOB_MAXIDX Response Class - No interaction takes place with the motion controller. Solution Class - Select the index for the element type so that it lies within the permissible numerical range. Error type - ID 40049 HLI HMI: addressed HLI section doesn't exist. Description Function blocks that can change the properties of user interface elements using the HLI interface require access to the corresponding area on the HLI. This access takes place using the global pointer gp Hmi Plc which is initialised by the function block MCV_Hli Interface during the PLC start-up phase. The error is displayed by such function blocks, if the pointer addresses an invalid address. Response Class - No interaction takes place with the motion controller. Solution Class - Check whether exactly one instance of the function block MCV_Hli Interface is called in the PLC application. Check whether the function block that displays the error is not called until the function block MCV_Hli Interface displays TRUE at its "Initialized” output. Error type - ID 40051 No drive with SERCOS interface within all axis specific interfaces. Description If this error message is displayed checking the drive type of all axes of the control system finished but there was no axis with drive type SERCOS found. Response Class - Solution Class - Check the axis parameter P-AXIS-00020 of the axes. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 725 Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages Error type - ID 40052 Value of SERCOS phase exceeds range 0..4. Description The value at the "Phase" input or output of a function block that allows access to the phase of a SERCOS ring does not correspond to the defined values for the phase of the SERCOS ring. Response Class - The job to read/write the phase of the SERCOS ring is aborted. Solution Class - After correcting the value at input "Phase", restart the job for when the value should be written. If the value of the phase of the SERCOS ring should be read, try to do it with another software tool. Error type - ID 40053 Error occurred while setting or commanding SERCOS phase. Description Reading or writing the phase of a SERCOS ring is not possible. The service is finished with an error. Response Class - Occurs error during writing the phase of the SERCOS ring, the job finishes, and there is no effect to the current phase of the SERCOS ring. When reading, the output "Phase" of the function block is set to value 0. Solution Class - Check whether SERCOS devices are configured in the control system or whether the controller start-up was completed without an error message indicating problems with the SERCOS fieldbus. Error type - ID 40055 FB error: MCV_Part Tracker. Maximum number of tracked parts exceeds number of managed parts. Description The function block manages a defined number (MAX_PARTS) of parts. However, the number of parts detected by the measuring probe exceeds this number. This is why the error is output at the "Error ID" output. Response Class - The function block goes to error state. Solution Class - Check if more parts really entered the probing area than exited it. Remove the error. When the function block is again commanded, the FB will exit its error state. Error type - ID 40056 FB error: MCV_Part Tracker. Position of next part is requested, but there is no part left in the administration. Description The function block receives over the input "Get Next Part Pos" the job to request the the position of the next part from the internal administration.

Error type - ID 40092 FB error: Searched axis within axis references by logical number, but didn't find such an axis. Description A job is sent via a function block, and the function block then shows TRUE at output "Busy". The FB receives a response for that job from de motion controller, and part of the response is a reference to an axis. The FB checks whether an axis reference (g_array_axis_ref[idx]) exists for this reference representing this axis. The reference in this case is the logical number of the axis. However, no axis representing an axis with this logical axis number is found. Because the FB doesn't find an axis reference that also points to that axis, “Error ID” output notifies this error code and output “Error” is set to TRUE.

Error type - ID 40093 FB error: Configured drive type doesn't support the configured drive interface. Description Some drive types (P-AXIS-00020) have additional interfaces implemented (e.g. exchange of specified drive data via a PLC interface) in addition to the default interface via which drive data is directly exchanged with the motion controller. Specific function blocks are implemented for each type of interface (P-AXIS-00572) in order to read or write drive data. Before access to this type of interface, each function block checks whether the interface for which it is implemented was configured in the axis lists. If the interface which the function block accesses is not configured depending on its implementation, the function block indicates an error. Response Class - No access is executed to an interface with drive data. 734 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Response Class - No access is executed to an interface with drive data. Solution Class - Check the configured values of P-AXIS-00020 and P-AXIS-00572 in the axis list. Possible combinations of the parameters values are: Value for P-AXIS-00572 Valu Drive type e Parameter does not exist in the - Any configurable drive type axis parameter list DRIVE_IFC_DEFAULT 0 Any configurable drive type (same effect as line above) HLI_DRIVE_IFC_0 1 PROFIdrive: 0x0003 CANopen: 0x0008 Error type ID 40095 FB error: Bus state notifies that bus communication is invalid. Description The function block no longer reads or writes data from/to the interface for drive data, because the fieldbus status reports that the transmission of data via the fieldbus is faulty. Response Class - No access to interface with drive data is executed. Solution Class - Check fieldbus and eliminate disruption. Error type - ID 40097 System error: More configured spindles notified than axes configured. Description During the start-up phase of the PLC application a check is made how many spindles were configured. They are axes in which the axis type is defined by ACHSTYP_SPINDEL in the axis parameter list (P-AXIS-00008) of the motion controller. If this error message appears, more configured spindles were signalled than there are axes. However, the number of spindles is always less than or equal to the number of axes.

Please give the complete error message data to the CNC manufacturer. Response Class 6 Solution Class 8 Requires controller restart. ID 42012 FB error: platform specific PLCopen interface couldn't adopt a new request. Request FIFO full. Description Jobs of platform-specific PLCopen function blocks are managed by a FIFO. The size of this FIFO is fixed (HLI_PLCO_PF_REQUEST_NUM). If more jobs are written to the FIFO in a PLC cycle than the space available, this error code is output to the function block whose job can no longer be sent to the motion controller. Response Class - The job is discarded by the function block and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Check if it is necessary for more jobs to be sent to the motion controller within a PLC cycle than places are available in the FIFO to solve the motion task. Error type - ID 42014 FB error: value at input "Vel Factor" exceeds allowed value range. Description Due to the implementation of the motion platform, the value at the "Vel Factor" input of the FB MC_Grp Set Override must be in the interval [0.0, 65535.0]. 738 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

The last correctly calculated override value is still active. Solution Class - Please assign a value within in the limits of the interval [0.0, 65535.0] to the input “Vel Factor”. Error type - ID 42015 FB error: Not able to push a job to local request job stack. Description An job is passed through several components of the control system. Every component which passes on a job writes its identifier to a stack belonging to the job. In this case, a copy of the received stack is generated locally when the job is commanded. The job writes its own identifier to the stack and the content of the local copy is passed on to the subsequent component. Is the stack full and the identifier can't be copied to the stack this error message is displayed. Response Class - The error is displayed at the output "Error" and "Error ID" of the function block. Solution Class - Please contact your motion control supplier. Error type - ID 42016 FB error: value at input "Time Factor" exceeds allowed value range. Description Due to the implementation of the motion platform, the value at input “Time Factor” of FB MC_Grp Set Time Override is limited to the interval [0.0, 65535.0]. Response Class - The FB sets the “Error” output to TRUE and the “Enabled” output to FALSE. The value that lies outside the limits is ignored.

Overview of CNC error messages 2.5.3 ID-range 44000-44249 ID 44000 FB error: axis-specific PLCopen interface couldn't adopt a new request. Request FIFO full. > Description Jobs of axis-specific PLCopen function blocks are managed by a FIFO. The size of this FIFO is fixed (HLI_PLCO_AXIS_REQUEST_NUM). If more jobs are written to the FIFO in a PLC cycle than the space available, this error code is output to the function block whose job can no longer be sent to the motion controller. Response Class - The job is discarded by the function block and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Check if it is necessary for more jobs to be sent to the motion controller within a PLC cycle than places are available in the FIFO to solve the motion task. Error type - ID 44001 FB error: axis reference changed, but former order isn't acknowledged. Description A job is to be sent via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB also sets the “Error” output to TRUE in the same PLC cycle and displays this error message at the “Error ID” output since the FB instance already sent a job for another axis that is still active. Therefore, a different variable of type AXIS_REF was assigned to the “Axis” input and a rising edge was applied to the FB “Execute” input. This is not permissible, otherwise the FB does not receive the job acknowledgement for the previously commanded axis and continues to be enabled. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - In general there are 3 possibilities to respond to this error code: 1. wait until the ongoing job is completed and then start the new job for the required axis. 2. interrupt the ongoing job by an instance of MC_Halt or MC_Stop. When the axis is then in the state of FB error: axis reference changed, but former order isn't acknowledged., the job for the re- quired axis can then be sent via the FB. 3. the implementation is designed so that an axis is always assigned a definite FB instance. This means that changes do not occur at the “Axis” inputs of the FB. Error type - ID 44002 FB error: order isn't acknowledged within a defined number of PLC cycles. Description After a defined number (MAX_RESET_WAIT_CYCLES) of PLC cycles, the job is still active and the function block did not receive the acknowledge information for that job. Response Class - The "Error" and "Error ID" outputs of the function block indicate the error situation. Function block switches to its idle state and is able to command a new job in the next PLC cycle. 740 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class - Check whether the motion controller is still running and calls its tasks cyclically. If the motion controller fails to run, restart the control system, otherwise contact your control system supplier. Error type - ID 44003 FB error: position exceeds allowed range. Description With the FBs MC_Home, MC_Move Absolute the value at the input “Position” is checked before the command is sent to the motion controller. This error code is output if the value is outside the interval of [-2147483648.0, 2147483647.0]. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Adjust the value at input “Position” so that it lies within the limits of the permitted interval. Afterwards, the FB can be reassigned. Error type - ID 44004 FB error: velocity exceeds allowed range. Description With FBs MC_Move Absolute, MC_Move Additive, MC_Move Relative, MC_Move Super Imposed, MC_Move Velocity and MC_Phasing, the value at the input "Velocity” or “Velocity Diff” is checked before a command is sent to the motion controller. This error message is output If the value exceeds the interval [1.0, 2147483647.0]. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Adjust the value at input “Velocity” or Velocity Diff” so that it lies within the limits of the permitted interval. Afterwards, the FB can be reassigned. Error type - ID 44005 FB error: acceleration exceeds allowed range. Description With FBs MC_Move Absolute, MC_Move Additive, MC_Move Relative, MC_Move Super Imposed, MC_Move Velocity, MC_Gear In and MC_Phasing the value at the input variable “Acceleration” is checked before a command is sent to the motion controller. This error message is output If the value exceeds the interval [1.0, 2147483647.0]. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Adjust the value at input “Acceleration” so that it lies within the limits of the permitted interval. Afterwards, the FB can be reassigned. Error type - ID 44006 FB error: deceleration exceeds allowed range. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 741 Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages Description With FBs MC_Move Absolute, MC_Move Additive, MC_Move Relative, MC_Stop, MC_Move Super Imposed, MC_Move Velocity, MC_Gear In and MC_Phasing the value at the input “Deceleration” is checked before a command is sent to the motion controller. This error message is output If the value exceeds the interval [1.0, 2147483647.0]. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Adjust the value at input “Deceleration” so that it lies within the limits of the permitted interval. Afterwards, the FB can be reassigned. Error type - ID 44007 FB error: MC_Home. Homing is still active, but is commanded again. Description The function block outputting this error message is to send a job to the motion controller to home an axis. However, this function block has already sent such a job to the motion controller and this job is still enabled as the motion controller has not yet sent an acknowledgement for this job. Response Class - The function block displays the error situation at his outputs "Error" and "Error ID" and then waits for the acknowledge for the active job that is still active. Solution Class - Prevent the command for homing as long as homing is still active. Error type - ID 44008 FB error: MC_Stop. Stop command is still active, but is commanded again. Description This is an error of an instance of the MC_Stop. The FB was commanded and sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because this FB instance already commanded a stop of the axis, but the motion controller hasn't finished up to now this stopping operation. Response Class - The job is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - If the error code is displayed, it is necessary to wait until the previous commanded stopping operation is acknowledged before placing a new job. In general, it must be prevented that a stop operation is ordered via an instance of the MC_Stop as long as a previous stopping order is still active. Error type - ID 44009 FB error: MC_Touch Probe. Touch probing is still active, but commanded again. Description This is an error of an instance of the MC_Touch Probe The FB was commanded and sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the FB is still waiting for acknowledgement of a previously commanded measurement job and then is commanded again to execute a measurement job again. Response Class - The job is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - Commanding a probing job must be prevented before a previously commanded probing job is acknowledged by the FB. 742 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages Error type - ID 44010 FB error: MC_Abort Trigger. Aborting touch probe is still active, but commanded again. Description This is an error of an instance of the MC_Abort Trigger. The FB was commanded and sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the FB is still waiting for acknowledgement of a previously commanded abort of a measurement job and then is commanded again to execute an abort. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - A command to abort a measurement process must be prevented before receipt of the acknowledgement of a measurement process that was already aborted. Error type - ID 44011 FB error: MC_Touch Probe. Touch probe channel changed, before the active request was acknowledged. Description A job for measuring the position was already sent to the Motion Controller via the MC_Touch Probe function block. This job is still enabled because the function block has not yet received an acknowledgement for the job. Now, another probing job is to be sent to the motion controller but the reference to the probing signal source was changed. This information is part of the structure which is assigned at the input "Trigger Input" and is stored in the variable FB error: MC_Touch Probe. Touch probe channel changed, before the active request was acknowledged.. This is not permitted as long as a job is active. Response Class - The new job is discarded and the error situation is displayed at the "Error" and "Error ID" outputs of the function block. The function block is still waiting for the acknowledge signal of the measuring job previously sent to the motion controller. Solution Class - As long as a job is enabled, neither the reference to the probing signal source nor the trigger mode of the measurement may be changed. Error type - ID 44012 FB error: MC_Touch Probe. Touch probe mode changed, before the active request was acknowledged. Description A job for measuring the position was already sent to the Motion Controller via the MC_Touch Probe function block. This job is still enabled because the function block has not yet received an acknowledgement for the job. Now, another measurement job is to be sent to the motion controller, but the trigger condition for the measurement process was changed. This information is part of the structure which is assigned at the input "Trigger Input" and is stored in the variable FB error: MC_Touch Probe. Touch probe channel changed, before the active request was acknowledged.. This is not permitted as long as a job is active. Response Class - The new job is discarded and the error situation is displayed at the "Error" and "Error ID" outputs of the function block. The function block is still waiting for the acknowledge signal of the measuring job previously sent to the motion controller. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 743 Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class - As long as a job is enabled, neither the reference to the probing signal source nor the trigger mode of the measurement may be changed. Error type - ID 44013 FB error: order not allowed, because an initialisation error occurred. Description This value is output if the axis state diagram of an axis is in the state 0 (INIT_STATE) when a FB is called. The cause is that the initialization phase of axis specific HLI areas isn’t finished, but the PLC application sends an order by commanding a FB that communicates with the motion controller by using this already not initialized interface. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - Command an axis not until the state of the axis is unequal INIT_STATE. Error type - ID 44014 FB error: order not allowed, because axis is in state STANDSTILL. Description An order should be send via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the axis is in state Standstill . This is the case if the ordered axis is at a standstill at this time and is not a slave axis of a synchronized movement. Therefore, it was not previously assigned by an instance of an MC_Cam In or MC_Gear In. If this had been the case, the axis would have been both in the state Standstill and the state Synchronised Motion. Response Class - The job is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - Axes that are at a standstill and are not slave axes of a synchronized movement at the time of commissioning must not be commissioned by an instance of a MC_Cam Out, MC_Gear Out or MC_Phasing. Error type - ID 44015 FB error: order not allowed, because axis is in state HOMING. Description A job is to be sent via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB also sets the “Error” output to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the axis already works off an order from an MC_Home instance and therefore is in state Homing . Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - In general, there are two possibilities to handle the situation: 1. wait until the job is finished, then transfer the axis into the state Standstill . 2. homing is aborted by a job to a MC_STOP. Afterwards, it’s possible to reassign the FB that notified the error code. Error type - 744 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual
## Page 745

Overview of CNC error messages ID 44016 FB error: order not allowed, because the axis is in state STOPPING. Description An order should be send via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the axis is in state Stopping . In the state Stopping an axis is located after a job by an instance of the MC_Stop and also when it is at a standstill and the "Execute" input of the MC_Stop has the value TRUE. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - An order by a MC_Stop instance can’t be aborted by another order. Therefore, you have to wait until the axis stands still. Before a new assignment by another FB, however, it must also be ensured that the "Execute" input has the value FALSE, because otherwise the axis remains in the state Stopping . Only on the falling edge at the “Execute” input sets the axis to the state Standstill. Afterwards, it’s possible to reassign the FB that notified the error code. Error type - ID 44017 FB error: order not allowed, MC notifies already an axis error. Description An order should be send via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the axis is in state Errorstop since the motion controller has already signalled an error for this axis. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - For the affected axis, a job must be sent via an instance of the FB MC_Reset. This acknowledges the reported error and sets the axis to the state Standstill . Now the axis is able to execute new orders from FB. Error type - ID 44018 FB error: order not allowed, because axis is in state DISCRETE_MOTION. Description An order should be send via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB also sets the “Error” output to TRUE in the same PLC cycle and displays this error message at the “Error ID” output because a motion command, triggered by an instance of an FB MC_Move Absolute, MC_Move Additive, MC_Move Relative or MC_Move Super Imposed is still active for this axis. This order had not yet been acknowledged with “Done” = TRUE. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller.

## Page 746

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class - General there exist three possibilities to handle the situation: 1. wait until the job is finished, then set the axis to the state Discrete Motion . 2. a new job is sent for the axis concerned which cancels the job that led to the state Discrete Motion . The job must therefore be com- manded in the state Discrete Motion but may not cause the state Discrete Motion of the axis in active state. These are, for example, requests to instances of the FB types MC_Halt and MC_Stop. If the axis is to be converted to another state, please refer to the PLCopen axis state diagram (see [MCP-P1//PLCopen axis state model]). 3. The commanded FB is an instance of MC_Reset. FB of this type can only send an order successfully if the axis is in state Errorstop . Afterwards, it’s possible to reassign the FB that notified the error code. Error type - ID 44019 FB error: order not allowed, because axis is in state CONTINUOUS_MOTION. Description An order should be send via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB also sets the “Error” output to TRUE in the same PLC cycle and displays this error message at the “Error ID” output because a motion command, triggered by an instance of an FB MC_Move Velocity, MC_Cam Out or MC_Gear Out is still active for this axis. This order had not yet been acknowledged with “Done” = TRUE. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - In general, there are two possibilities to handle the situation: 1. a new job is placed for the axis concerned, which leads to a change in the axis state. The job must therefore be commanded in the state Continuous Motion . These are, for example, jobs from instances of the FB types MC_Halt and MC_Stop. If the axis is to be converted to another state, please refer to the PLCopen axis state diagram (see [MCP-P1//PLCopen axis state model). 2. The commanded FB is an instance of MC_Reset. FB of this type can only send an order successfully if the axis is in state Errorstop . Afterwards, it’s possible to reassign the FB that notified the error code. Error type - ID 44020 FB error: order not allowed, because axis is in the state SYNCHRONIZED_MOTION. Description A job is to be sent via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the axis is in state Synchronised Motion . The state Synchronised Motion results from assigning the axis via MC_Cam In or MC_Gear In. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. 746 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual
## Page 747

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class - In general, there are two possibilities to handle the situation: 1. A new job is placed for the axis concerned, which leads to a change in the axis status. The job must therefore be commanded in the state Synchronised Motion . These are, for example, jobs from instances of the FB types MC_Halt and MC_Stop. If the axis is to be converted to another state, please refer to the PLCopen axis state diagram (see [MCP-P1//PLCopen axis state model]). 2. The commanded FB is an instance of MC_Reset. FB of this type can only send an order successfully if the axis is in state Errorstop . Afterwards, it is possible to reassign the FB that notified the error code. Error type - ID 44021 FB error: order not allowed, because axis is in unallowed state. Description Before a job for an axis is sent to the motion controller, it is checked if the job is allowed. If this error message is output, the axis is in a state that is unknown and therefore not allowed. Note: The PLCopen specification defines an axis state graph that defines states for an axis controlled by PLCopen function blocks. Furthermore the diagram there defines which PLCopen commands change the actual axis state and which PLCopen commands are allowed for the actual state of the axis. Response Class - The "Error" and "Error ID" outputs of the function block indicate the error situation. Function block is able to command a new job in the next PLC cycle. Solution Class - Please contact your motion control supplier and mention the error number. Error type - ID 44022 FB error: order not allowed, because axis state is invalid. Description A job should be send via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the commanded axis is in a state that isn't covered by the implementation. Response Class - The job is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - Check whether the value of the element axsd_state in variable of type AXIS_REF that is applied at input “Axis” is changed by the PLC application, although there is no job enabled for this axis. If that is not the case, please contact the controller supplier and quote the error number. Error type - ID 44024 FB error: order not allowed, because touch probing is still active. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 747 Diagnosis manual
## Page 748

Overview of CNC error messages Description A job is to be sent to the motion controller via an instance of the FB MC_Touch Probe. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the measurement channel that is applied at input “Trigger Input” is occupied by a touch probing job that was sent before. Response Class - The job is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - In general, there are two possibilities to handle the situation: 1. the previous touch probing job is aborted by an instance of the MC_Abort Trigger. 2. wait until the previous touch probing job is finished. Afterwards, it’s possible to reassign the FB that notified the error code. Error type - ID 44025 FB error: order not allowed, because aborting touch probing is still active. Description This is an error of an instance of the MC_Touch Probe or MC_Abort Trigger. The commanded FB also sets the “Error” output to TRUE in the same PLC cycle and displays this error message at the “Error ID” output because a touch probing order is still active and not acknowledged until now. Response Class - The job is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - If the error code is displayed, wait until the previous commanded probing abort is acknowledged before placing a new job. In general, a probing process must be prevented from starting or the abort of a probing process must be prevented as long as an order to abort a probing process is still active. Error type - ID 44026 FB error: order not allowed, because MC_Touch Probe is in an undefined state. Description A job is to be sent to the motion controller via an instance of an MC_Touch Probe or MC_Abort Trigger. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle because the measurement channel that is applied to input “Trigger Ref” is in a state that is not covered by the implementation. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Check whether the value of the element tp_state.tpsd_state is changed by the PLC application in the variable of type AXIS_REF applied to the "Axis" input, even though there is no active job for probing positions or aborting a probing job. If that is not the case, please contact the controller supplier and quote the error number. Error type - 748 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages ID 44027 FB error: order not allowed, because input "Execute" of any MC_STOP instance is TRUE. Description A job is to be sent via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the input “Execute” is currently set to TRUE for one or more instances of the FB MC_Stop affecting this axis. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Check at which instance of a FB of type MC_Stop the input "Execute" is set to TRUE and the axis reference is the same as at the FB that displays this error message. Then set the value of the input "Execute" of this instance of the MC_Stop to FALSE. Afterwards, the FB that returned this error code can be reassigned. Error type - ID 44028 FB error: order not allowed, because axis is in state DISABLED Description A job is to be sent via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the axis is in state Disabled .

Error type - ID 44040 FB error: value at input "Ratio Denominator" is 0. Description With this function block, the value at input "Ratio Denominator" is checked at rising edge at input "Execute" before the command is sent to the motion controller. Because the value is the denominator of a gear ratio the value cannot not be 0, otherwise this error code is output. Response Class - The order is dismissed by the function block and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - Adjust the value at input “Ratio Denominator” so that it is not equal to 0. Afterwards, it’s possible to reassign the function block. Error type - ID 44043 FB error: value 0 at input "Gear Nr" is not a valid identification number for a gear. Description This function block checks the value at input "Gear In" on the rising edge at input "Execute" before the command is sent to the motion controller. This value is the identification number of a gear stage. According to the definition, this identification number is an integer and > 0. Response Class - The job is discarded by the function block and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Adjust the value at input “Gear In” so that it is > 0 and an integer. Afterwards, the function block can be reassigned. Error type - ID 44044 FB error: MC_Gear Shift. Gear shift command is still active, but is commanded again. 752 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual
## Page 753

Overview of CNC error messages Description This is an error of an instance of the MCV_Shift Gear. The FB was commanded and sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because this FB instance already commanded shift of the gear stage of an axis, but the motion controller hasn't finished up to now the operation of shifting the gear. Response Class - The job is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - If the error code is displayed, wait until the previous commanded gear stage operation is acknowledged before placing a new job. In general, it must be prevented that an instance of the MCV_Shift Gear is used to order a gear change as long as a previous gear shift order sent via this FB instance is still active. Error type - ID 44045 FB error: Logical axis number less than 1 is invalid. Description The function block checks the value that should be a logical axis number. Valid logical axis numbers in the environment of the motion controller are integer values greater than 0 according to the definition. The error code is displayed because the value doesn't match the criteria. Response Class - The function block displays the error. No further evaluation will be executed and no command will be sent to the motion controller. Solution Class - It's a function block • that gets the value for the logical axis number by an input of the function block, the value has to be changed according to the definition for logical axis numbers (>0, integer). • that doesn't get the value by the PLC application, but internal accesses the value, please contact your control system supplier and tell the function block type displaying this error. Error type - ID 44046 FB error: MC error occurred while reading/writing of configuration parameters. Description Specific error of FB that handle reading/writing of parameters. Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44047 FB error: MC warning occurred while reading/writing of configuration parameters.

Response Class - The message code is displayed at output "Error ID" oft he function block. The outputs "Error" and "NCWarning" are set to TRUE. The warning code generated in the motion controller is displayed at output "NCError Code" Output "Valid" displays FALSE. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 753 Diagnosis manual
## Page 754

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class - Determine the problem that caused the warning of the motion controller by checking the code at output "NCError Code" and fix the problem. Afterwards on rising edge at input "Execute" the function block can send further commands to the motion controller. Error type - ID 44049 FB error: MCV_Set Drive Mode. Value at input "Drive Mode" is invalid. Description Function block MCV_Set Drive Mode has an input "Drive Mode". The operation mode in which the drive is to be operated is then transferred to the operator. The value transferred on the rising edge at the "Execute” input is invalid for this operation mode. Response Class - The job triggered with the rising edge at the "Execute" input is not forwarded to the motion controller. Solution Class - Assign input "Drive Mode" a valid value for the drive mode and reassign the function block again. Valid values for the drive operation modes are: Global constant Value Meaning HLI_LR_DRV_POS_CTRL 0 Position control HLI_LR_DRV_VEL_CTRL 1 Velocity control HLI_LR_DRV_TORQ_CTRL 2 Torque control HLI_LR_DRV_POS_TORQ_CTR 3 Position control with torque L pilot control Error type ID 44050 FB error: order not allowed, because axis is in state TORQUE_CONTROL. Description A job is to be sent via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets output “Error” to TRUE and displays this error code at the output “Error ID” in the same PLC cycle, because the axis is in state Torque Control . The state Torque Control results from the assignment of the axis via MCV_Set Drive Mode. Response Class - The job is dismissed by the FB and not issued to the motion controller. Solution Class - The state Torque Control can only be changed by a job sent by an instance of MCV_Set Drive Mode, whereas a value not equal to 2 (HLI_LR_DRV_TORQ_CTRL) must be applied at input “Drive Mode”. After this job is received, the axis is in state Standstill. Afterwards, it is possible to reassign the FB that notified the error code. Error type - ID 44052 FB error: Axis reference has to point to a SAI axis or reference. 754 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44053 FB error: Axis reference has to point to a SAI axis, a axes group axis or an IO station. Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44054 FB error: Axis reference has to point to a SAI axis or an encoder axis. Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44055 FB error: Axis reference has to point to a SAI axis or an axes group axis. Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44056 FB error: Axis reference points to an axis that isn't configured as spindle. Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44057 FB error: MC_Power. Power can't be switched on for a CANopen drive, because a drive bus error occurred. Description The error is output because the function block is to send a job to the motion controller that leads to data being exchanged via the fieldbus using the CANopen protocol. However, the fieldbus is not ready for cyclic data transmission. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 755 Diagnosis manual
## Page 756

Overview of CNC error messages Response Class - As long as the error is present, the function block sets the "Error" output to TRUE and outputs the error code at the "Error ID" output. It makes a cyclic check whether the fieldbus is ready to communicate. If it then detects that the fieldbus is ready for cyclic data transmission, its subsequent reaction depends on the type of the function block. If the type is MC_Power, the reaction depends on the values assigned to inputs "Enable", "Enable_Positive" and "Enable_Negative". If these inputs are still assigned TRUE, the drive is enabled as long as no other error occurs. Solution Class - If the function block is of type MC_Power, nothing else needs to be done since the error is only output if the inputs "Enable", "Enable_Positive" and "Enable_Negative" are set to TRUE. You can still wait and check when the state of output "Status" displays TRUE as soon as the drive is switched on and under control. Error type - ID 44058 FB error: MC_Power. CANopen drive isn’t ready to switch power on. Description The error is output because the function block MC_Power commands the motion controller to bring the drive of an axis under control, but via its status data (2#0000000 = GC_CO_NOT_READY_TO_SWITCH_ON) the drive signals that the controller is still performing self-tests and the CAN communication is not yet working. Response Class - As long as the drive sends this status information, the function block sets the output "Error" TRUE and displays the error code at output "Error ID". Its subsequent reaction depends on the values assigned to inputs "Enable", "Enable_Positive" and "Enable_Negative" and the status that the drive sends to the motion controller. Solution Class - Nothing else needs to be done since the error is only output if the inputs "Enable", "Enable_Positive" and "Enable_Negative" are set to TRUE. You can still wait and check when the state of output "Status" displays TRUE as soon as the drive is switched on and under control. Error type - ID 44059 FB error: MC_Power. Power for a CANopen drive can't be switched on, because drive release isn't set by the hardware. Description The error is output because the function block MC_Power commands the motion controller to bring the drive of an axis under control, but via its status data (2#0100000 = GC_CO_NO_DRIVE_RELEASE) the drive signals that the drive has not yet been enabled by the controller. Response Class - As long as the drive sends this status information, the function block sets the output "Error" TRUE and displays the error code at output "Error ID". Its subsequent reaction depends on the values assigned to inputs "Enable", "Enable_Positive" and "Enable_Negative" and the status that the drive sends to the motion controller. 756 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual
## Page 757

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class - Nothing else needs to be done since the error is only output if the inputs "Enable", "Enable_Positive" and "Enable_Negative" are set to TRUE. You can still wait and check when the state of output "Status" displays TRUE as soon as the drive is switched on and under control. Error type - ID 44060 FB error: MC_Power. State machine implemented within CANopen drive doesn't react as expected. Description When a CANopen drive is switched on, the drive controller passes through several states. The correct sequence of states is monitored in the function block MC_Power. The error is output because the combination of previous and current states may not occur during the power-on sequence. The sequence of states during drive power-on is: 1. GC_CO_SWITCH_ON_DISABLED_1 or GC_CO_SWITCH_ON_DISABLED_2 2. GC_CO_READY_TO_SWITCH_ON 3. GC_CO_SWITCHED_ON 4. GC_CO_OPERATION_ENABLED. Response Class - As long as the drive sends this status information, the function block sets the output "Error" TRUE and displays the error code at output "Error ID". Its subsequent response depends on the values assigned to inputs "Enable", "Enable_Positive" and "Enable_Negative" and the status data sent by the drive. Solution Class - Check why the power-on sequence was interrupted. Once the problem has been solved, you can command the MC_Power again. Error type - ID 44062 FB error: MC_Gear In A value of the data type MC_Gear In Mode must be transferred to the input pin “mode”. Description The function block MC_Gear In has a "Mode" input to determine how the slave axis and master axis are coupled. The error message is output because an invalid value is assigned to input "Mode". Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Assign a valid value to the "Mode" input. Please refer to the description of the function block MC_Gear In [MCP-P1//MC_Gear In] for permissible values. A rising edge at the "Execute" input sends a new job to the motion controller. Error type - ID 44064 FB error: Functionality is not implemented. Description A function block displays this error message if it has no functionality. Response Class - Output this error message. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 757 Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class - Do not use this function block in the current PLC application and PLC environment. Error type - ID 44065 FB error: Axis reference of slave axis has to point to a SAI axis. Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44066 FB error: Axis reference of master axis has to point to a SAI axis. Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44069 FB error: Repeated command of FB discarded since previous job sent was not acknowledged. Description A job is to be sent via an FB to the motion controller. The commanded FB sets the “Error” output to TRUE in the same PLC cycle and displays this error message at the “Error ID” output because the FB is supposed to send a new job but is still busy with a job sent earlier. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Either wait until the previous job sent is acknowledged by the FB or an FB was commanded to abort the job previously sent. Afterwards, the FB can be commanded again. Generally, this case can be prevented if you ensure that a new job is not sent via an FB before a previous job already sent is acknowledged. Error type - ID 44070 FB error: value at input of type LREAL exceeds allowed value range of -2147483648.0 .. 2147483647.0. Description The function block outputting this error message has at least one input of type LREAL. A value that is outside the interval [-2147483648.0, 2147483647.0] was assigned to one of these inputs. The value range of this input is limited because the value is assigned internally to a REAL variable. Response Class - The job is discarded by the FB and not transferred to the motion controller. Solution Class - Assign a valid value to the corresponding input. A rising edge at the "Execute" input sends a new job to the motion controller. 758 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Please give the complete error message data to the CNC manufacturer. Response Class 6 Solution Class 8 Requires restart of controller- ID 44075 FB error: Axis specific PLCopen interface can't take order, because it's occupied by another order. Description A function block that uses an axis specific PLCopen control unit to command jobs to the motion controller can't send a job because the control unit is occupied. The error is displayed after function block has made further attempts unsuccessfully to send the job. The number of attempts is defined by global constant MAX_RETRIALS. By default MAX_RETRIALS = 0. Therefore, this error usually occurs when more than one function block places an order per PLC cycle and these are to be sent to the motion controller via the same axis specific PLCopen control unit. Response Class - The job isn't executed. Solution Class - Check whether more than one function block sends jobs to the Motion Controller during a PLC cycle via the same axis-specific PLCopen Control Unit. If this is the case, change the PLC application accordingly so that this no longer occurs. Error type - ID 44076 FB error: MCV_Conveyor Control; Value at input "Control Mode" is invalid. Description There is an invalid value assigned to input "Control Mode" of function block MCV_Conveyor Control. Allowed values at input "Control Mode" are: Global constant FB error: MCV_Conveyor Control; Value at input "Control Mode" is invalid. HLI_CONVEYOR_SPEED_CONST 0 HLI_CONVEYOR_ACCELERATION 1 HLI_CONVEYOR_DECELERATION 2 HLI_CONVEYOR_SPEED_ZERO 3 HLI_CONVEYOR_MACH_WITH_SPEED_ZER 4 O Response Class - The invalid value is not sent to the motion controller via the corresponding control unit. Solution Class - Correct the assigned value. The corrected value is sent immediately to the motion controller if input "Enable" is TRUE. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 759 Diagnosis manual

Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44078 FB error: The motor is coupled already. Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44079 FB error: For coupling or decoupling, MC_Power must be disabled. Description Response Class - Solution Class - Error type - ID 44082 FB error: MC_Power. Invalid value at input Power Default State, a valid value is used. Description The drive was switched ready for operation using MC_Power. To switch off the drive, at least one Enable_... input of the MC_Power was set to FALSE. When the MC_Power function checks the shutdown job, it detects that the value at the Power Default State input determining the target state at shutdown is invalid. This would prevent the drive from being switched off. Response Class - The FB corrects the invalid value at the Power Default State input internally to the valid value mcv Power State Ready For Power. By applying this value, the drive can be shut down so that it does not react to command values. If a valid value is applied to input Power Default State, the FN can be commanded again. The output Error displays FALSE and Error ID displays no error. Solution Class - The values at input Power Default State must be of type FB error: MC_Power. Illegal value at input Power Default State, a valid value is used.. Please apply one of these values. If the applied value was calculated by the application, check why the value exceeds the allowed range. Error type - 760 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

The errors are displayed in an array, whereby the oldest error has the index 0 and the most current error always has the highest index, even if the array size is not large enough to display all the errors that occur. The errors that occur must be manage for this procedure. If the counter for the errors that occurred becomes negative,there was a system error. Response Class - FB sets output “Error“ to TRUE and output “Valid“ to FALSE. Solution Class - Please contact the controller supplier and quote the error number. Error type - ID 46022 FB error: index of axis within axis group at Ident In Group reference exceeds the limits. Description The function block outputting this error has an input of type IDENT_IN_GROUP_REF. The content of this data structure is used to determine an axis in the axis group. This data structure contains, among other things, the classification of the axis in the axis group. This classification is determined by an index number. This error is displayed because it is determined, during execution of the function block, that the index number is outside the valid range of [0.. HLI_SYS_AX_MAXIDX]. The global constant HLI_SYS_AX_MAXIDX is defined in the HLI library [HLI]. Response Class - The job results in no response from the motion controller. Solution Class - Choose the index number that defines the place of the axis within the axis group so that it is within the range of [0.. HLI_SYS_AX_MAXIDX]. 766 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages ID 46056 An operation mode change is discarded because in same plc cycle more than one operation mode was commanded. Description The MCV_Grp Operation Mode function block is used to change the operation mode (Standby, Automatic, MDI, Homing, Manual Mode) of an axis group and then command the required state (Start, Stop, Reset) in this operation mode. The function block is implemented so that there is an input for each operation mode and state. The error message is always output if no job is sent to the motion controller. There are 2 reasons for this: 1. No unique command for the motion controller can be derived from the signals at the inputs for operation mode and state. This is possible if several inputs for switching the operation modes or states receive a rising edge in a PLC cycle. 2. It is not permissible to switch to a different operation mode from every constella- tion of operation mode and state. The permissible constellations are listed below. ◦ The NC program, manual block or homing is finished or interrupted by a stop. ◦ The axis group is in manual mode or in standby mode. Response Class - No job is sent to the motion controller. Solution Class - Check whether one of the two reasons listed in the description applies to why the operation mode change is not executed. Change the PLC application appropriately to prevent this from reoccurring. Error type - ID 46057 No filename or filepath was assigned to input Param Auto. Description An axis group is in operation mode Automatic mode. To start an NC program, a rising edge was applied to the "Start" input of the MCV_Grp Operation Mode function block. To start the NC program, the file containing the NC program must be defined via the “Param Auto” input at the time of the rising edge at the “Start” input. Assign the filename or absolute filepath for this file to the “Param Auto” input as a character string. An error is output since only an empty character string is applied to the “Param Mdi” input at the time of the rising edge at the “Start” input. Response Class - No job is sent to the motion controller. Solution Class - At the time of the rising flank at the “Start” input of the MCV_Grp Operation Mode function block, assign a valid filename or absolute filepath to a file containing an NC program to the “Param Auto” input. Error type - ID 46058 No NC block was assigned to input Param Mdi. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 775 Diagnosis manual

Overview of CNC error messages ID 50025 No interpolation for axis in tracking mode. Description The path axis is moving or is to be moved although the axis is in tracking mode (command position = actual position). There are different reasons why an axis is in tracking mode: 1. The user commands axis tracking mode via the High Level Interface by setting the HLI signal of the control unit lr_mc_control.follow_up.command to TRUE. (For detailed information on CNC real-time control signals, see [HLI// Control commands of an axis]. 2. The axis reverts automatically to tracking mode (internal tracking mode). Possible reasons for this include: ◦ This status indicates that the drive is not ready for operation (not yet initialized). ◦ There is no valid process data received from the drive. ◦ The drive is in error state. ◦ The axis is parked (Profidrive drive). Response Class 4 Movement stop. Solution Class 6 Reset the lr_mc_control.folllow_up.command signal or eliminate the cause for internal tracking mode.

Overview of CNC error messages Description A jump operation commanded by the HLI (Control Unit) moves the electrode as fast as possible away from the workpiece and generates a flushing movement. The flushing movement evacuates removed particles and prevents short circuits from causing and excessive load on the electrode. During a jump, the DR channel may not move until the jump is completed. Before a jump is commanded, the PLC must ensure that both the DR and the ORBIT channels are at standstill and do not move either during the jump. For example, this can be ensured with a feedhold in the DR and ORBIT channels. This error is output if a movement takes place. Response Class 6 Movement stop.

ID 50933 ESCAPE activation must be done before ORBIT activation for optional mark of APPROACH path. Description The die sinking configuration consists of the three channels DR, ORBIT and ESCAPE. Before machining with an orbiting movement, it is possible to define an APPROACH geometry in 3D space. In this geometry, with the DR channel moves the electrode forwards or backwards at negative velocities or jumps of the ESCAPE channel. This APPROACH geometry is implicitly detected between activation of the ESCAPE channel and activation of teh ORBIT channel. For this reason, the ESCAPE channel must be defined first followed by the ORBIT channel, even if an APPROACH geometry is not required. Response Class 6 Movement stop.

Overview of CNC error messages Description The “Delete distance to go” function (see FCT-C28) interrupts the current path motion and generated a linear path motion to the target position of the next motion block of the selected end identifier. Certain block types, e.g. a measuring motion G100, may not be changed or omitted. In this case, the controller generates this warning and produces a linear path motion to the start point of the block that cannot be changed or omitted. The “Delete distance to go” is then deselected. Response Class 1 Generate a direct path motion to the NC block that cannot be changed or omitted. Solution Class 1 Check and modify the PLC command “Delete distance to go” Parameter %1: Block number [-] Block number before which the “Delete distance to go” function was implicitly deselected.

Overview of CNC error messages ID 51044 Invalid combination: NC command #FILTER or #VIB GUARD has no effect. Description The FIR filter and the Vibration Guard cannot be used together or combined. The two functions can be influenced both via the axis parameters and via the NC program. • FIR-Filter - #FILTER[…] • Vibration Guard - #VIB GUARD[…] If combinations occur due to an NC command programmed at a later date, this command has not effect. Response Class 1 Warning. Solution Class 1 When the FIR filter or the Vibration Guard is activated via the axis parameters, the NC commands used must always match. Error type 1, Error message from NC program. ID 51045 Warning: Functionality Vibration Guard activated with NC command #VIB GUARD in all axes. Description With the Vibration Guard function, the NC command #VIB GUARD always acts on all axes. If a Vibration Guard was not activated in all axes, this NC command now activates the Vibration Guard in the axes where the Vibration Guard was previously not activated. Response Class 1 Warning. Solution Class 1 If the Vibration Guard should only act in some axes, this cannot be controlled by the NC command. Axis specific use can only be achieved by parameterisation and activation in the axis lists (see P-AXIS-00588, P-AXIS-00571, P- AXIS-00589, P-AXIS-00568). Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Logical axis number (P-AXIS-00016) of concerned axis. Error type 1, Error message from NC program. ID 51046 The measured position is before the trigger position for probing in the movement block. Description When measuring to a fixed stop, a measured value was acquired before the configured enable position for acquiring the measured value (P-AXIS-00776, P- AXIS-00777). The output of this error message can be suppressed by the channel parameter P- CHAN-00312. In this case, it is necessary to check whether a correct measurement was performed by checking the variable V. A. MERF.*. Response Class 6 Error message output abort program.

ID 51047 During active "delete distance to go" an invalid value of dist_to_geom_end_r is monitored. Description The originally programmed contour was modified by the “Delete distance to go” function. However, the readout dist_to_geom_end_r refers to the original programmed contour, which is why a "Delete distance to go" in a sequence flagged with #DIST TO GO BEGIN/END results in an incorrect readout. Response Class 1 Warning, no reaction. Solution Class 1 Avoid “Delete distance to go” in the program section. Error type - ID 51048 Too small P-STUP-00033 leads to delayed display of the HLI variable dist_to_geom_end_r. Description The NC command #DIST TO GO BEGIN flags the start of a sequence for which the axis path is to be calculated up to the end of the sequence with #DIST TO GO END. The entire sequence must be available in order to determine the axis path up to the end of the sequence. This is not always possible if P-STUP-00033 is parameterised too small. If the memory is too small, the axis travel path cannot be calculated up to the #DIST TO GO END flag and the display via the HLI datum dist_to_geom_end_r remains invalid until the sequence is fully available. Response Class 1 Warning, no reaction. Solution Class 1 Check and correct the parameter P-STUP-00033 Parameter %1: Block number [-] Block number of the last NC block that is still within the sequence. Acts as a reference point for increasing P-STUP-00033. Error type - ID 51049 Monitoring levels in activated areas has to be identical. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 929 Diagnosis manual

Error type - ID 51090 Preparation of a measurement was aborted. Description An axis can be prepared for a measurement run by the NC command #MEAS PREPARE The preparation was aborted. Possible causes for abortion: • Program end was reached without execution of a measurement run. • An axis prepared for a measurement run was removed from the channel; measurement preparation is aborted for all axes. • Homing was programmed for a prepared axis; measurement preparation is aborted for all axes. Response Class 1 Output of the warning; preparation for the measurement run aborted. Solution Class 1 Check and modify the flow in the NC program Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Logical axis number P-AXIS-00016 of axis affected Error type - ID 51091 A position initialisation in the channel is not allowed while orbiting motion is active. Description When the interface between an orbit channel and a down channel is active and when a radius is > 0, the orbit channel transforms the supplied radius to the orbit geometry. Due to this asynchronous superimposition, it is not possible to perform position synchronisation in the down channel. If position synchronisation is required while the interface is active, the radius in the down channel must first be moved to 0. Response Class 7 Controlled halt of the axis, the control loop is closed. Solution Class 6 Check and modify the NC program. The NC block specified in the error results in position synchronisation.

Solution Class 6 Generally there are 2 possibilities to avoid this message: increase the value of P-AXIS-00268 so that the command velocity for the axis is less than P-AXIS-00268. or command a velocity value for this axis that is smaller than P- AXIS-00268. With both methods, it is essential to know the source of the command velocity value in order to move a non-homed axis.

ID 70020 Dynamic position lag exceeds maximum. 1012 Version: 1.251 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Diagnosis manual
## Page 1013

Overview of CNC error messages Description When the axis was moved, the position lag exceeded a permissible limit for the current motion velocity. Dynamic tracking/following error monitoring ([FCT-A1// Section: Description]) calculates the permissible position lag as a function of motion velocity when an axis is moved. It is configured individually in the lists for axis parameters ( P-AXIS-00167, P-AXIS-00168, P-AXIS-00169, P-AXIS-00170, P-AXIS-00172, P-AXIS-00176 and P- AXIS-00191). The NC controller provides two different methods to calculate the maximum permissible position lag: Type 1: Standard methods – Use a parameterisable filter Type 2: Linear method – is based on a theoretical position lag Possible causes of an excessive position lag may be, for example: • Accelerations specified too large for the axis • The occurrence of friction in the actuating system • The axis is blocked and cannot move freely • Poorly set position controller (for gain factor see P-AXIS-00099) • Drive type SERCOS: If different proportional gain values are used in the drives and the axis parameters. Possible solutions: • Reduce the command accelerations • Ensure free movement of the axis • Check setting (gain factor Kv, see P-AXIS-00099) of position controller • If necessary, change the parameterisation of the dynamic tracking/position lag monitoring ([FCT-A1// Section: Axis parameters]) Response Class 8 Controlled halt of the axis, the control loop is open.

ID 70021 Positive software limit switch actuated. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 1013 Diagnosis manual
## Page 1014

Overview of CNC error messages Description The current actual position of the axis is greater than the position of the positive software limit switch. See also FCT-A2// Section: Description] The positions of the software limit switches are used to monitor the command and actual position of an axis. They are specified for each axis in the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00177, P-AXIS-00178). In order to monitor actual positions, an additional tolerance (see P-AXIS-00179) can be specified to prevent a slight overshoot of an axis from triggering an error message. In the NC program, the positions of the software limit switches can be set or changed by the NC commands G98/G99. Possible causes: • Incorrect NC program. • Overshoot of axis is too great. Possible solutions: • Correct the NC program • Check the proportional gain factor (see P-AXIS-00099) of the position controller and reduce it if necessary. • Increase tolerance for position controller (see P-AXIS-00179) Response Class - Closed-loop controlled axis stop. Solution Class - Correct the NC program, reduce overshoot of the axis Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Logical axis number of affected axis see P-AXIS-00016 %2: Drive type [-] Drive type of concerned axis, see P-AXIS-00020 %3: Current value [0.1 10^-3 mm or ø] Current position of the axis %4: Lower limit value [0.1 10^-3 mm or ø] Position of the positive software limit switch; see P-AXIS-00178 %5: Block number [-] Block number of the NC program where the error occurred.

Overview of CNC error messages Description The current actual position of the axis is smaller than the position of the negative software limit switch. See also FCT-A2// Section: Description] The positions of the software limit switches are used to monitor the command and actual position of an axis. They are specified for each axis in the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00177, P-AXIS-00178).

Error type - ID 70023 Sign error: trend monitoring actuated. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 1015 Diagnosis manual
## Page 1016

Overview of CNC error messages Description Trend monitoring detected a sign error. It is used for monitoring the sign of the control and encoder signals and can be activated for each axis via the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00189). Possible error causes: • The positive or negative motion directions of the command and actual values do not match. • The manipulated variable has the wrong sign. The axis moves in the wrong direction when the NC commands G0/G1 are used. Possible solutions: • If the motion directions of the command and actual variables do not match, change the sign in the measurement system or in the drive amplifier. Alternatively, it is possible to specify a sign reversal of the actual position in the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00230) • If the manipulated variable has the wrong sign, change it either in the drive or in the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00231).

Description During homing (see [FCT-M1]), an error occurred with a SERCOS drive. Possible cause: Some SERCOS drives require a minimum distance between the position marker pulse and the position marker in order to complete drive-controlled homing successfully. Otherwise the position marker pulse cannot be detected precisely. Solution: • Consult the documentation of the drive manufacturer for further error diagnosis. • Check the ID number S-0-0298 whether the position marker pulse must be moved and by what distance.

## Page 1019

Overview of CNC error messages Description Unable to continue motion without homing. Cause: The limit (see P-AXIS-00220 at which the measurement system delivers faulty signals can be exceeded at higher speeds, especially with spindles. The position controller must therefore be switched to controlled operation.

Overview of CNC error messages Error type 11, Error message from position controller. ID 70050 - 70080 System error [} 12] Description This error message informs about internal states, error solutions and the place of error in the source. Please give the complete error message data to the CNC manufacturer. Response Class 7 Solution Class 8 Requires controller restart. ID 70081 Position lag at standstill too great. Description While the axis is at standstill, the position lag is exceeded. The position lag monitoring function (see [FCT-A1// Section: Description]) monitors whether the current position lag of an axis exceeds a limit. It is configured individually in the lists for axis parameters ( P-AXIS-00167, P-AXIS-00168, P-AXIS-00169, P- AXIS-00170, P-AXIS-00172, P-AXIS-00176 and P-AXIS-00191). There are two different methods to monitor position lag during axis standstill: Type 1: Standard methods – Use a parameterisable filter Type 2: Linear method – is based on a theoretical position lag Possible causes of an excessive position lag may be, for example: • External force acting to move the axis from the stationary position. • If the gain factor set in the position controller is too small (see P-AXIS-00099), the permanent position lag is too large. Therefore, the axis fails to reach the specified command position. Response Class 5 Abrupt axis stop for defective axis Solution Class 6 Possible solutions: • Remove the influence of the external force • Increase the proportional gain factor Kv (see P-AXIS-00099) of position controller • If necessary, change the parameter setting of the position lag monitoring function ([FCT-A1// Section: Axis parameters]) Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Logical axis number of affected axis, see P-AXIS-00016 %2: Drive type [-] Drive type of axis affected, see P-AXIS-00020 %3: Current value [0.1 µm or 0.0001°] Current position lag %4: Upper limit value [0.1 µm or 0.0001°] Maximum allowed position lag %5: Block number [-] Block number of the NC program where the error occurred Error type 11, Error message from position controller.

Overview of CNC error messages ID 70082 Axis not within position window at end of settling time. Description The axis is not within the tolerance window at the end of the settling time. The position lag monitoring function (see [FCT-A3// Section: Description]) monitors whether the actual position reaches an exact stop window (see P-AXIS-00236) within a certain period of time (see P-AXIS-00532) when approaching a target position. If the interpolator no longer supplies any command values, the command position of the axis has reached its programmed target position and time monitoring is started. It is deactivated when the actual position of the axis is within the exact stop window. Possible error causes: • An incorrectly adjusted position controller, e.g. excessive permanent control deviation or excessive overshoot. • Excessive friction in the mechanical system. • The axis is blocked and cannot move freely Response Class 5 Abrupt axis stop for defective axis Solution Class 6 Possible solutions: • Increase the proportional gain factor of the position controller if the control deviation is excessive. • Reduce the gain factor of the position controller if the axis oscillation is excessive (see P-AXIS-00099). • Reduce friction in the mechanical system • If necessary, increase the exact stop window (see P-AXIS-00236) or the settling time (see P-AXIS-00532) Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Logical axis number of affected axis, see P-AXIS-00016 %2: Drive type [-] Drive type of axis affected, see P-AXIS-00020 %3: Upper limit value [µs] Maximum permitted settling time see P-AXIS-00532 %4: Block number [-] Block number of the NC program where the error occurred %5: Current value [-] Amount of the actual position lag in increments Error type 11, Error message from position controller.

ID 70091 Position deviation after tracking operation too big. Description After switching off tracking mode, the position deviation occurring is greater than the limit specified in the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00056). When tracking mode is active, the axis can be moved out of its command position. This leads to a difference between the original command position and the current position. If tracking mode is activated while a program is executed or manual control is active, the axis moves back to the original position after tracking modeends, provided the position lag occurring is smaller than the value specified in the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00056). Otherwise, this error message is displayed. Response Class 5 Abrupt axis stop for defective axis Solution Class 6 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 1025 Diagnosis manual

Error type 11, Error message from position controller. ID 70191 Axes have been moved. Recovery not possible. Description With the help of the recovery function, the current status of the controller (e.g. the axis positions) can be stored on a permanent data carrier before it is closed so that it can be reloaded when it is restarted. Since the axes were moved in the meantime, the recovery data can no longer be used. For example, the stored positions differ from the actual axes positions. Response Class 7 Controlled stop of axes affected Solution Class 6 Discard recovery data or do not move the axes Error type - ID 70192 SLOPE error at interpolation to selection position after end of tracking mode. Description During tracking mode, it is possible to move the axis manually. To continue an interrupted NC program without position offset, the axis must be moved back to its initial position (see P-AXIS-00258). Therefore, the controller moves the axis at the specified velocity (see P-AXIS-00208) back to the old position if the difference between the actual positions at the beginning and the end of tracking mode is smaller than the specified limit (see P-AXIS-00056). However, an error occurred during interpolation of the command value curve. Possible cause is a very small position difference, for example.

Description The maximum permissible axis acceleration is set too low in the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00008). The position controller uses 1 increment per cycle time^2“ as the dimension for the maximum permissible axis acceleration (1 increment is equivalent to 0.1 µm for translatory and 0.0001° for rotary axes). The smallest representable acceleration value in the position controller is therefore “0.1 µm per cycle time^2” or “0.0001° per cycle time^2”. The acceleration specified in the axis parameters (dimension mm/s^2 or °/s^2) is converted into the position controller internal unit format. The acceleration value cannot be represented in the position controller if it is too small.

ID 70209 Emergency deceleration too small (less than 1 increment per cycle). Description The deceleration for an emergency stop is set too small in the axis parameters (see P-AXIS-00003). The position controller uses “1 increment per (cycle time)^2” as dimension of the emergency deceleration (1 increment is equivalent to 0.1 µm for translatory and 0.0001° for rotary axes). The smallest representable deceleration value in the position controller is therefore “0.1 µm per cycle time^2” or “0.0001° per cycle time^2”.

ID 70212 Value of 'field_bus_allows_optimized_schedule' is not identical for all axes. Description The setting “field_bus_allows_optimized_schedule” in the axis parameters must be identical for all axes. This option is switched off by default. In this case, new manipulated variables are first calculated in the position controller using the command values of the interpolator from the last cycle. Only then are new command values requested by the interpolator. This reduces the time needed for the calculation of the set command values (e.g. reducing the temporal jitter). If this option is switched on, new actual values are requested by the interpolator at the beginning of each position controller cycle and new manipulated variables are only calculated afterwards. This eliminates the cycle offset (one cycle) of the generated command values. Response Class 1 Warning. The function is turned off.

Description The correction value offset calculated by the distance control (see FCT-M3) exceeds the permissible limit. Due to safety reasons, the maximum deviation caused by the distance control between the programmed position in the NC program and the real actual position of the axis can be limited with the parameter P-AXIS-00414. Possible error causes: 1. The deviation between command height (SET_POS) and actual height of the workpiece surface is too large. In this case, the command height should be com- pensated and the NC program should be regenerated with the new command height. 2. The workpiece may possibly contain a large indentation at this point, e.g. a hole. Deactivate distance control at the position to avoid a collision with the workpiece. In addition, there is a risk of possible damage to the probe if a (contacting) sensor is used. 3. Strong changes in height of workpiece surface. In this case, an attempt can be made to increase the permissible limit P-AXIS-00414. Possibly reduce path velo- city so that distance control can follow the strong changes in height.

## Page 1107

Overview of CNC error messages Description The actual spindle speed exceeds the parameterised maximum speed by at least 10%. Spindle speed is automatically limited to the maximum speed set in the tool data so this error message should never occur. Possible causes: • Incorrect configuration of velocity scaling either in the controller or in the drive. • Malfunction in the drive. • Insufficient parameter setting of speed or position control loop causing overshoot in the actual speed by more than 10%. Response Class 5 Stop axis. Solution Class 6 Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Log. axis number (see P-AXIS-00016). %2: Current value [1µm/s or 0.001°/s] Current actual axis speed. %3: Upper limit value [1µm/s or 0.001°/s] Maximum permissible axis speed. %4: Current value [-] Current actual axis speed in increments per cycle. Error type 11, Error message from position controller. ID 70377 The actual value simulation was activated when speed monitoring was active. Description Simulation of actual value positions was activated with active spindle speed monitoring. The actual value simulation is activated when the current spindle speed is higher than the maximum encoder velocity set in P-AXIS-00220. When the encoder velocity limit is exceeded, it is assumed that the encoder does not deliver valid actual values any more; monitoring the spindle speed is not possible in this case. Response Class 7 Program abort Solution Class 6 Increase P-AXIS-00220 or reduce the maximum spindle speed. Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] %2: Error value [-] Error type 11, Error message from position controller. ID 70378 Invalid start position in axis-specific command position transformation. Description When using axis-specific transformations P-AXIS-00380, an invalid position jump was detected. A change of the two solution variants or wrong ACS axis position, when selected at the crank, leads to a position jump. The permissible position jump can be modified with transformation parameters; the default value is 5 degrees. This error message is generated if the current active position difference exceeds the default or adjusted parameter.

Description The maximum distance set in the parameter P-AXIS-00404 for zero pulse search or to search for encoder overflow is smaller than the distance covered by an encoder revolution. The distance covered in an encoder revolution can be defined by: 1. When the parameters P-AXIS-00092, P-AXIS-00362 and P-AXIS-00363 are used to parameterise path resolution, the parameter P-AXIS-00092 contains the num- ber of encoder increments per motor revolution. 2. When homing on encoder overflow, the number of increments per encoder re- volution is defined by the minimum value of P-AXIS-00355 and the modulo range (P-AXIS-00126 and P-AXIS-00127) of the axis. Response Class 5 Correct the value of P-AXIS-00404 to the distance the axis moves during an encoder revolution; output of a warning. Solution Class 1 Correct the value of P-AXIS-00404 so that the axis can move at least one encoder revolution during the zero pulse search. Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Logical axis number (P-AXIS-00016) of affected axis %2: Current value [0.1 µm or 0.0001°] Distance moved within one encoder revolution. %3: Error value [0.1 µm or 0.0001°] Set value of P-AXIS-00404. %4: Corrected value [-] Corrected value of P-AXIS-00404.

## Page 1109

Overview of CNC error messages Description During homing, the maximum permissible path set in parameter P-AXIS-00404 for searching the zero pulse or the encoder overflow was exceeded. Possible reasons for this error message are: • Invalid set value of P-AXIS-00404. • Encoder defective or incorrectly wired. • Incorrect parameterisation of drive amplifier with respect to encoder evaluation. • Incorrect configuration of process data between drive and CNC. Response Class 7 Stop of axis, output of error message. Solution Class 6 Possible solutions: • Set correct value of P-AXIS-00404 • Replace encoder or wire correctly. • Correct parameterisation of encoder evaluation in drive amplifier • Check and correct configuration of process data between drive and CNC Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Axis number (P-AXIS-00016). %2: Current value [-] Maximum permissible path during zero pulse search (value of P-AXIS-00404) %3: Limit value [-] Covered distance since start of zero pulse search. %4: Current value [-] Current actual axis position in increments. %5: Current value [-] Axis position at start of zero pulse search in increments. Error type 1, Error message from NC program. ID 70381 Actual value request when back interpolation is active. Description During the backward interpolation of an axis after tracking mode actual positions were requested with the command # CHANNEL_WR INIT [ACTPOS ....] . Response Class 7 Program execution stop Solution Class 6 Change NC program sequence or PCL program. When actual positions are requested with the command #CHANNEL INT [ACTPOS...], they are tracked internally; it is therefore necessary to activate tracking mode via the HLI.

Overview of CNC error messages ID 90015 Change of selection mode not permitted using direct selection. Description If TRC (G138) is selected directly, it is not possible to change the selected side after the first motion block. When indirect selection (G139) is used and then a motion bock follows without any relevant motion data in the current main plane, a change is made implicitly to direct selection mode. Therefore, this error may also occur with G139. Example: V. G. WZ_AKT. R = 5 G139 G90 G01 X10 Y10 F1000 G42 G01 X10 Y10 ; implicit change from G139 → G138 G41 G01 X30 Y12 ; the error 90015 is also output here. … Response Class 2 Abort NC program processing.

ID 90019 Contour error due to compensation motion within linear motion block. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.251 1209 Diagnosis manual
## Page 1210

Overview of CNC error messages Description To detect contour violations in linear blocks, the direction of the programmed motion block is compared with the direction of the corrected motion block. If the directions are opposite, this means a contour violation. The movement opposite to the programmed direction is called compensatory movement. This can be caused by a relatively small motion block, e.g. smaller than the tool radius, which leads to contour violations when calculating the equidistant path. When using contour masking with G141, this error is not output because the contour masking process would delete the contour loop. In the figure above, the triangle would be removed with N20' and thus no contour damage occurs. [PROG// Section: Limits of TRC] Response Class 2 Abort NC program processing Solution Class 6 Possible solutions are: • Use a tool with a smaller radius • Use contour masking (G141) Error type 1, Error message from NC program.

## Page 1213

Overview of CNC error messages Description To detect contour violations in circular blocks, the corrected circular angle is compared with the original programmed angle. If the corrected circular angle is greater than the programmed one, the contour will be damaged. This is referred to as the compensation motion. The figure above shows that if the direction of rotation is maintained at N20', the equidistant arc would damage the contour. This may be caused by a relatively small motion block, e.g. smaller than the tool radius. This leads to contour violations when calculating the equidistant path. When using contour masking with G141, this error is not output because the closed contour loop is deleted. In the figure above, this would remove the circular motion of N20' and thus no contour damage would occur. [PROG// Section : Limits of TRC] Response Class 2 Abort NC program processing.

## Page 1216

Overview of CNC error messages Description NC commands, which cause an emptying of the channel, are not permissible while TRC is active. These commands include, for example, the #FLUSH command. The error only occurs when the TRC is already deselected. This may occur when the direct or indirect deselect method is used and when G05 is used. In this two methods, tool radius compensation requires a motion block after G40 to reduce the offset built up by the tool radius. Test program with occurrence of the error: N100 G139 ( indirect selection mode) N110 G41 G01X100 Y100 ( select TRC ) N120 G01 X140 Y20 F2000 N130 G03 X160 Y40 R20 N140 G01 X200 N150 G01 X220 Y20 N160 G40 ( deselect TRC ) N170 #FLUSH N180 G01 X0Y0 Corrected test program : N100 G139 ( indirect selection mode) N110 G41 G01X100 Y100 ( select TRC ) N120 G01 X140 Y20 F2000 N130 G03 X160 Y40 R20 N140 G01 X200 N150 G01 X220 Y20 N160 G40 G01 X0 Y0 ( Deselect TRC ) N170 #FLUSH The decisive difference between the two test programs is the path motion after deselection with G40, since the distance between the tool to the programmed contour is only cancelled after this motion. In order to avoid the error, a motion block must be positioned between G40 and the command triggering the flushing of the channel when direct (G138) or indirect (G139) deselection are used. [PROG Section: Flushing NC channel] Response Class 2 Abort NC program processing. Solution Class 6 Check and modify the NC program.

Description To detect contour violations in linear blocks, the direction of the programmed motion block is compared with the direction of the corrected motion block. If the directions are opposite, this means a contour violation. The movement opposite to the programmed direction is called compensation movement. This type of motion was detected and the contour masking process activated. See [PROG// Section: Limits of TRC] The principle of the outline fading out consists of removing the loop from the corrected path. For this purpose, the contour masking buffers a certain number of blocks corrected via the TRC.

## Page 1227

Overview of CNC error messages Description Inner corner selection (G238) of the TRC checks the transition angle between selection block and the first motion block. The first motion block means the block that forms the distance between the tool radius and the programmed course. There is an upper limit for this transition angle and this was exceeded. Response Class 2 Abort NC program processing. Solution Class 3 Check and modify the point of selection of TRC. Parameter %1: Error value [-] Transition angle: selection block – first motion block %2: Upper limit value [-] Upper limit of transition angle. Error type 1, Error message from NC program. ID 90131 Compensation motion of selection block of tool radius compensation not allowed. Description A motion block was marked as a compensation motion for the contour masking process that cannot be eliminated. This motion block is either the first one after selection of TRC with active contour masking, or the first one after selection of contour masking with active TRC. The cause for compensation motion is either a motion block that is too short after selection of TRC or a tool radius that is too large. When the command #FLUSH CONTINUE is used in the NC program, the disputed motion block is placed directly before the #FLUSH CONTINUE command. This is caused by the TRC outputting the control block to flush the channel (#FLUSH CONTINUE) before the disputed motion block since the TRC retains this motion block for the interpolation point calculation that follows. Response Class 3 Abort NC program processing. Solution Class 3 Check and modify the NC program and the tool used. • Use a tool with a smaller radius. • Move selection of TRC or contour masking in the NC program • When #FLUSH CONTINUE is used, place this command at a different position in the NC program Parameter %1: Block number [-] Number of the disputed motion block.

Overview of CNC error messages Description The parameter P-AXIS-00761 activates the restore function for the last position controller position at controller start-up. This function is used for axes whose measurement system only provides an absolute position within a limited range (e.g. within one motor revolution) or whose absolute encoder overflows in the motion range. For these axes, the identification code "absolute measurement system” P- AXIS-00014 must therefore not be set, otherwise an incorrect reference position is used under certain circumstances, e.g. if remanent data is lost. If the axis measurement system actually supplies an absolute position within the entire motion range, it can be used directly. An automatic position restoration is not necessary. Response Class 1 The function to restore the last position controller position is disabled Solution Class 1 Check and modify the parameters P-AXIS-00014 and P-AXIS-00761 Parameter %1: Logical axis number [-] Logical axis number (P-AXIS-00016) of affected axis %2: Current value [-] Value for P-AXIS-00761 to restore the last position controller position %3: Error value [-] Incorrect identifier P-AXIS-00014 for absolute measurement system %4: Corrected value [-] Corrected identifier P-AXIS-00014 for absolute measurement system Error type 2, Error message by data transfer from parameter list into control device.

Overview of CNC error messages Solution Class 1 The maximum permissible velocity limit in manual mode depends on whether it is a pure manual mode (G200) or a parallel interpolation of axis motions takes place (G201). Pure manual mode The parameter P-AXIS-00077 of the axis parameter data record, or the value of the commanded continuous jog velocity if commanded by another application, must be changed so that these values are smaller than P-AXIS-00213. Manual mode with parallel interpolation The parameter P-AXIS-00077 of the axis parameter data record or, if commanded by another application, the value for the commanded continuous jog velocity must be changed so that these values are smaller than P-AXIS-00212 Continuous jog velocity is greater than maximum velocity.

Error type 2, Error message on data transfer of parameter lists to controller. ID 150105 Live cycle of key push finished. Description One of the two incremental jog or continuous jog manual operation modes is activated for the axis. If these manual modes are active, movement of axis is controlled by input from keys. A time period (number of CNC interpolator cycles) has been transmitted with the message to the CNC that a corresponding key has been pressed, at the end of which the CNC automatically generates the "End of keystroke" command and stops the path motion of the axis unless the corresponding "End of keystroke" message has previously been sent to the CNC. Message occurs because after a “begin key stroke”-event time expires the given interval to send corresponding “end of key stroke”-event. Response Class 1 Warning CNC internal creates the “end of key stroke”-event. With continuous jog mode enabled, all axes to which this key is assigned and which are moved via this key will stop. With incremental jog mode enabled, the axes will continue to move further if there is any distance to go of the jog step size. Therefore the event doesn't affect the movement of the axes. Solution Class 1 To prevent this output of this message, the corresponding “End of button press” event must be sent to the CNC within the commanded “Duration of button press” after the message of a “Start of button press” event is sent to the CNC.

Overview of CNC error messages Description The CNC tries to forward a job from another application (e.g. HMI) to the PLC. The job contains data on which input device (e. g. key, handwheel) commands a specific axis in manual mode. This job to assign an input device to an axis, however, could not be written within a defined number of CNC cycles via the associated control unit of the interface to the PLC because this control unit is still occupied by a previously transmitted data. Check the following points in the PLC application: 1. The request semaphore in the control unit must be reset by the PLC after each transfer of data from an activation request for manual mode. 2. The PLC cyclically checks the Control Unit for newly received data. 3. If the PLC is not to handle an activation request for manual mode, the Enable flag of the corresponding Control Unit is set to False.

Overview of CNC error messages Description The programmed TCP of the couple kinematics cannot be reached. This may be because of missing degrees of freedom or the turning axis of a member kinematic is programmed separately and is in conflict with the programmed TCP. Example: 1. A configured couple kinematic consists of linear axes. However, a rotation axis of the TCP is programmed in the NC program. The TCP with the configured member kinematics cannot be reached as the rotary degree of freedom is missing. 2. Couple kinematic consisting of a robot and the same rotation axis (e.g. C axis) is programmed with different values for the robot and the TCP (e.g. C_TCP=45 C_ROB=10). Response Class - Depending on the module where error occurs: • Abort NC program processing. • Movement stop.
