Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

Packaging Machine State 2 Packaging Machine State The “Packaging Machine State” function blocks have a common interface to the existing “Pack ML Machine State Model” versions. It is expected that application-specific logic such as state transitions are programmed in external function blocks and that the “Packaging Machine State” function block takes over the central logic of the state machine and the state display. For that reason there is a recommendation for this function block with regard to how it can be combined with other logic. The state transition in a machine application is always application-specific. For that reason it is best to design linked “State” function blocks with Pack ML State Machine V3 in order to simplify the standardization. The "State" function blocks acquire application-specific signals and represent the transition logic to adjacent states (see Pack ML state model). The "State" function blocks supply feedback to PS_Pack ML_State_Machine_V3, as a result of which a standard state machine and a state message are possible. The "State" function blocks contain the machine execution code and the application-specific transition logic. The "State" function blocks are listed below and are programmed by the application programmer in such a way that the integrity and functionality of the Pack ML State Machine are retained. Names of the “Pack ML State Machine V3” function blocks: • PS_Starting • PS_Completing • PS_Resetting • PS_Holding • PS_un Holding • PS_Suspending • PS_Clearing • PS_Stopping • PS_Aborting • PS_Execute • PS_Complete • PS_Idle • PS_Held • PS_Suspended • PS_Stopped • PS_Aborted Requirements Development environment Target system type PLC library to include Twin CAT v3.1 Build 4018 and PC (i386) Tc3_Pack ML_V2 higher 2.1 Interfaces 2.1.1 I_Unit State This interface can be implemented in the unit function blocks of the application and makes available all methods of the Packaging State Model, which can then be filled as required with application code.

It is assumed that application-specific logic, such as state transitions, is programmed in external function blocks and that the PML_State Machine function block deals with the central logic of the state machine and the state representation. The Machine State Model has a different appearance due to the currently active Unit Mode (e Mode). Three basic modules are preconfigured for this (E_PMLProtected Unit Mode [} 11]).

Packaging Machine State 2.3.1.3 PML_Unit Mode Manager Machines have other system modes apart from “Production”. Each unit mode is defined by its own state model. A "Mode Manager" must be defined for transitions between the modes. The “Mode Manager” decides how and in which state a machine can change unit modes; i.e. built-in barriers prevent the machine from changing to unsuitable states. These barriers are permanently defined for the “Production”, “Maintenance” and “Manual” base modes, as the illustration below shows. This can be individually specified for other modes defined via the PML_Unit Mode Config [} 17] function block. WARNING Adhere to proper mode changes The logic for transitions between the modes depends on the application, especially for transitions between "Manual" and "Production" mode. In addition, hardware barriers or safety equipment may be necessary for such mode changes. The responsibility for proper mode changes lies with whoever implements them. 20 Version: 1.2.4 TE1000

The Stop Reason remains in the Stop Reason array until it is pushed out of the array by the next Stop Reason. So that a valid timestamp can be entered, the function block PML_Admin Time should be called cyclically in the program.

Packaging Machine State 2.3.2.2 PML_Admin Time This function block should be called cyclically and it then fills the following Admin-Pack Tags: • Plc Date Time • Acc Time Since Reset • Mode Current Time[ ] • Mode Cumulative Time[ ] • State Current Time[ ][ ] • State Cumulative Time[ ][ ] The length of time that the machine was in different states for is thus recorded. In the further process, this allows conclusions to be drawn about the machine efficiency. To ensure that the times are calculated correctly, it is a prerequisite that the Unit Current and State Current Status-Pack Tags have already been written coherently.

Packaging Machine Tags 3 Packaging Machine Tags 3.1 Introduction Pack Tags provides a uniform set of naming conventions for data elements that are used in the procedural elements of the Base State Model. As described, the Base State Model provides a uniform set of machine states, so that all automated machines can be considered in the same way. Pack Tags are data elements provided with names for the interoperable data exchange between automated machines with open architectures. This documentation contains the key names of the data elements, data types, values, fields and data structures, if applicable. Pack Tags are used for machine-to-machine communication, e.g. between a bottle filler and a cap fitter. Pack Tags can also be used for the exchange of data between a machine and superordinated information systems such as Manufacturing Operations Management and Enterprise Information Systems. The documentation describes all Pack Tags for the navigation through a state model and for the definition and actuation of the system control mode. Furthermore, this documentation defines a list of Pack Tags, which may describe important machine information. All Pack Tags must be used in order to conform to the principles of integrated connectivity with systems with the same implementation. The tags required are those that are needed for the function of the automated machine or for the connectivity to control or remote systems. 3.2 Tag Types Pack Tags are broken down into three groups: Command, Status and Administration. Command and State tags contain data for interfacing the machine with the line control for coordination or for downloading recipes/ parameters. Command tags are transferred as “information recipients” to the machine program and “consumed” by it. State tags are created and read by the machine program. Administration tags contain data, which are collected by higher-level systems for machine performance analysis or operator information. The grouping of data should take place in adjacent registers, in order to optimize the communication. Information data are usually transferred via OPC in an Ethernet-based communication network. The prefix of Command tags is “PMLc”. The prefix of State tags is “PMLs”. The prefix of Administration tags is “PMLa”. 3.3 Tag Details The following section provides an overview of the tags. Command, state and administration Pack Tags are listed in the following tables. TE1000 Version: 1.2.4 33
