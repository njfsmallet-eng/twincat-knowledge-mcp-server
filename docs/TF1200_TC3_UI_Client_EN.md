Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

FAQ 5 FAQ 1. The Twin CAT 3 UI Client reports the error code -202 (ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID) when connecting to a web page via HTTPS. [} 15] 2. How can the Twin CAT 3 UI Client start automatically after logging on to the operating system? [} 15] 3. How can the operating system automatically log in a user after the boot process? [} 16] 4. How can the Twin CAT 3 UI Client start with different web applications? [} 16] 5. How can the display and touch input under Twin CAT/BSD® be used in portrait mode? [} 17] 6. How can I create relevant log files for the UI client under Twin CAT BSD? [} 17] 1. The Twin CAT 3 UI Client reports the error code -202 (ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID) when connecting to a web page via HTTPS. Background: The certificate used for the HTTPS connection is classified as insecure by Chromium because it is not known to the operating system (e.g. self-signed certificates). Answer: The following options are available: Use an official certificate for the web server that is configured as trustworthy for the operating system or trust the self-signed certificate if this is trustworthy. Alternatively, set the switch in the configuration: command Line Switches": ["ignore-certificate-errors"] 2. How can the Twin CAT 3 UI Client start automatically after logging on to the operating system? Answer: The following options are available under Windows: Create a link from the Twin CAT UI Client in the Twin CAT Start Up folder. Path: Twin CAT\3.1\Target\Start Up When Twin CAT switches to Run Mode, the Twin CAT UI Client is started. If Twin CAT is operated in configuration mode, you can create a link from the Twin CAT UI Client in your user's startup directory. You can access the folder directly using the following command (shortcut Windows + R): Shell:startup TF1200 Version: 1.2.0 15

FAQ Path: %App Data%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup The following options are available under Twin CAT/BSD: When installing via the setup-full.sh script, the autostart can be set up via the "--autostart" parameter. The setup-autostart.sh script is located under /usr/local/etc/Twin CAT/Functions/TF1200-UI-Client/scripts, with which the autostart can be set up subsequently. 3. How can the operating system automatically log in a user after the boot process? Answer: Under Windows, a user can be configured for Auto Logon in the Twin CAT project under the SYSTEM node and the Settings tab. The following options are available under Twin CAT/BSD When installing via the setup-full.sh script, the autostart can be set up via the "--autostart" parameter. The setup-autologin.sh script is located under /usr/local/etc/Twin CAT/Functions/TF1200-UI-Client/scripts, with which the autostart can be set up subsequently. 4. How can the Twin CAT 3 UI Client start with different web applications? The executable file of the Twin CAT 3 UI Client can be given a path to another configuration file via the -config-path parameter. This means that several Twin CAT 3 UI Clients can start different web applications in parallel when kiosk mode is disabled. The configuration can be copied and adapted from the existing one. Alternatively, a new Config can be created using the --exit parameter. The --config-path parameter is used to specify the path and name of the new Config 16 Version: 1.2.0 TF1200

FAQ Under Windows, the shortcut can be given the parameters for further configuration in the properties: Only one UI Client is currently supported under Twin CAT/BSD. 5. How can the display and touch input under Twin CAT/BSD® be used in portrait mode? The UI client under Twin CAT/BSD® uses the Sway window manager. For portrait mode, the image under the touch input must be rotated by 90 or 270 degrees. To do this, add the following lines to the Sway configuration file (path: /home/TF1200/.config/sway/config) with administrator rights and restart the operating system or Sway. output * transform 90 input type:touch calibration_matrix 0 1 0 "-1" 0 1 6. How can I create relevant log files for the UI client under Twin CAT BSD? By default, the UI client sends output and error messages to the console. It may be helpful to write the information to a file for error analysis: 1. Open the sway configuration file with admin rights (path: /home/TF1200/.config/sway/config) 2. At the end of the file, add the redirection of messages and errors to a file: exec "/usr/local/etc/Twin CAT/Functions/TF1200-UI-Client/TF1200-UI-Client" > /home/TF1200/ TF1200-UI-Client.log 2>&1 Sway also sends the output and error messages to the console. To redirect to a file, proceed as follows: 1. Open the configuration file from the user’s Autostart with admin rights (path: /home/TF1200/.shrc) 2. At the end of the file, add the redirection of messages and errors to a file: sway -c "/home/TF1200/.config/sway/config" > /home/TF1200/sway.log 2>&1 TF1200 Version: 1.2.0 17
