Overview 2 Overview The Twin CAT 3 function enables serial data communication for the Twin CAT 3 PLC. The following three options are available for the communication: Option 1: PC COM ports You can address your physical COM port directly from the PLC. Option 2: Beckhoff terminals The network-based fieldbus system from Beckhoff can be used to access serial terminals at a distance of up to 100 m. The following Beckhoff terminals are supported: • KL6xxx Bus Terminals • EL60xx Ether CAT Terminals Option 3: Virtual COM ports The function provides an ADS server for accessing virtual COM ports of the operating system from the PLC. This makes it possible to use USB devices that come with a proprietary USB-to-Virtual Com driver. The COM port must register in Windows as 'COM1' ... 'COM255'. In the Twin CAT/BSD operating system the COM port must register as `ttyu0`...`ttyu255`. Installation required To use virtual COM ports, it is necessary to install the TC3 Function Setups on the system in which the virtual COM port exists. Components of the Twin CAT 3 function: • PLC library Tc2_Serial Com: The PLC library provides function blocks and data structures for communicating with serial devices. Various function blocks for sending, receiving and configuration are available. All function blocks support multiple instances, so that, depending on the processing capacity of the PC, any number of serial interfaces can be operated in parallel. In addition to the basic send and receive functions for transparent data, the 3964R protocol is supported. A fail-safe protocol for transmitting any data is implemented. A checksum in combination with repetition of faulty telegrams provide the error protection. The RK512 protocol is used to transmit data blocks such as are used in Siemens controllers. The user 8 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340
## Page 9

Overview only has to parameterize the RK512 function block. It uses the 3964R protocol and handles the necessary telegram traffic. It supports the transmission of data blocks with a length of up to 128 data words. • Twin CAT Tc Ads Serial Comm Server: The service is started and stopped together with Twin CAT. It is used to communicate with virtual COM ports of the operating system. Otherwise, this component can be omitted during installation. TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 9

Configuration 4 Configuration 4.1 Tutorial This tutorial guides the user through the complete implementation of a serial communication. The following tasks are explained step by step: • Adding the required PLC library • Configuring the PLC background communication to ensure the data exchange with the process image • Implementation of a small PLC application that sends and receives data • Task configuration • Adding the hardware component and linking with the PLC process image The tutorial is suitable for all hardware interfaces: Pc COM port, EL6xxx or KL6xxx terminal. Further examples and a download option for the Twin CAT project described here can be found in section Examples [} 73]. 4.1.1 Add library to PLC project Create a new PLC project to start integration of the library for the demo implementation. In your PLC project select "Add Library" from the References node. Navigate to the category Communication/Serial and select the library Tc2_Serial Com: 18 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340
## Page 19

Configuration 4.1.2 Sending and Receiving Data is sent and received from the standard task. The example program included sends data by way of different serial hardware interfaces. At the same time data with correct prefix and suffix is received. If a loop back adapter is connected to the serial hardware interfaces, the sent characters are received again and again. Many other use cases exist. For example data can be sent by way of the serial PC interface to a printer. Or a bar code from a scanner that is connected to a serial bus terminal can be received. TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 19
## Page 20

Configuration Possible errors More than one character may be transmitted during one PLC cycle, provided they can be accepted by the send buffer. If the send buffer overflows, the busy output of the send block will remain TRUE after it has been called. In that case the last character is not sent, and the block must be called again with the same input data in the next PLC cycle. How full a buffer is can be determined at any time (e.g. Tx Buffer. Count or Tx Buffer. Free Byte). 4.1.3 Background Communication Communication between the serial hardware and the data buffer, whose type is Com Buffer [} 64], is handled in the standard task or in a separate fast task depending on the hardware specifications. A fast separate task will be necessary at high baud rates or with KL6001 terminals which have a small process image (3 or 5 data bytes only). See also the Communication Principle [} 31]. The tutorial uses the following three hardware interfaces: hardware interface background communication Pc COM port in standard task EL6001 in seperate fast task KL6001 (3 bytes) in seperate fast task data strutures Four data structures are needed to access a serial interface. We distinguish between two different kinds of data structures: - Hardware dependent structures provide the connection to the hardware in the send and receive directions. - Two data buffers are also necessary for intermediate storage.

Configuration 4.1.4 Task Configuration The speed of the serial interfaces must be considered for the task configuration (see the section on Supported Hardware [} 29] and the Communication Principle [} 31]). For example, in order that, with 9600 bps at the serial bus terminal, the data can all actually be processed at this speed, the associated communication block must be active at least once per millisecond. The task that operates the function block must have a correspondingly fast setting. The simplest case is when the entire PLC program runs in this fast task. If the task is set slower, then as long as the interface operates with a hardware handshake, the communication will function at reduced speed. Without handshake, data to be received can be lost. NOTICE Data loss possible When using KL6xxx Bus Terminals on BKxxxx Bus Couplers, please note that the K-bus update time must be below the cycle time of the task. The K-bus update time can be read in the Twin CAT System Manager after clicking on the bus coupler below the I/O configuration. A reserve of 10 % to 20 % should be taken into account. If there are many bus terminals on one bus coupler, the cycle time of the task may have to be set to at least 2 ms. 4.1.5 Serial PC Interface The PC’s standard serial interface is entered into the I/O configuration as a new I/O device. 22 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340
## Page 23

Configuration After this the interface is configured: TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 23
## Page 24

Configuration Only the KL6xx1 emulation operation is supported. Data bytes must be set to 64 bytes. The interface parameters are set appropriately in the application. Sync mode: In Sync mode, communication with the interface hardware is synchronised with the communication task. This setting usually offers benefits at high baud rates, as long the cycle time of the communication task is short enough. At 115 k Baud, for example, 12 characters are received each millisecond. The interface therefore has to be operated with a maximum cycle time of 1 ms, in order to avoid overflow of the 16-byte hardware FIFO. If the cycle times are too long, there is a risk of buffer overflow. If Sync mode is switched off, the interface is served via the Windows timer interrupt every millisecond, irrespective of the task cycle time. This mode is not real-time capable, and with high computer utilisation longer operating intervals may be experienced. In this case, with very high baud rates there is also a risk of buffer overflow. It is recommended to activate Sync mode and to adjust the cycle time of the communication task to the baud rate in such a way that overflow of the 16-byte hardware buffer is avoided. For smaller baud rates and with a slower communication task, Sync mode may perhaps be deactivated. The next step is to link the inputs and outputs to the corresponding data structures in the PLC (types Pc Com In Data [} 69] and Pc Com Out Data [} 69]) by means of multiple linking. 24 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340
## Page 25

Configuration The new configuration is activated, and the system is restarted. 4.1.6 Serial Ether CAT Terminal The serial Ether CAT terminal is entered into the system under a Ether CAT coupler. TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 25
## Page 26

Configuration Then the input and output data is linked with the corresponding PLC variables (of types EL6in Data22B [} 69] bzw. EL6out Data22B [} 69]). 26 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340
## Page 27

Configuration The new configuration is activated, and the system is restarted. The serial settings are typically already set in the system configuration in the Co E of the Ether CAT terminal. Recommended is the insertion of these values into the startup-list to facilitate a hardware exchange. The serial settings can be configured via Co E at run time too. 4.1.7 Serial Bus Terminal KL6xxx in 3-Byte Mode The serial bus terminal is entered into the system under a bus coupler. TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 27
## Page 28

Configuration Then the input and output data is linked with the corresponding PLC variables (of types KL6in Data [} 67] and KL6out Data [} 67]). The new configuration is activated, and the system is restarted. 28 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340
## Page 29

Configuration KL6xxx in 5-Byte Mode Before a KL6xxx bus terminal can be used in 5-byte mode, it must be appropriately reconfigured. This can not be done through Com Lib while running, but must be performed with the Beckhoff KS2000 configuration program. The terminal is then permanently set for 5-byte mode. The serial bus terminal is now entered into the system under a bus coupler. Then the input and output data are individually linked to the corresponding PLC variables (of types KL6in Data5B [} 68] and KL6out Data5B [} 68]). The new configuration is activated, and the system is restarted. 4.2 Supported Hardware The maximum effective data transfer rate (Bps) depends on the cycle time (T) of the PLC and the number of bits per transferred data byte (LB = 1 start bit + n data bits + p parity bits + m stop bits). The maximum effective data transfer rate is limited upwards by the physical baud rate programmed in the bus terminal. Example 1: When using an EL6001 terminal and a baud rate of 9600 baud, a cycle time of maximum 6 ms is necessary. Example 2: When using a PC COM port and a baud rate of 115200 baud, a cycle time of maximum 2 ms is necessary. Serial Ether CAT Terminals EL60xx in 22-byte mode (EP60xx im 22-byte mode) The serial Ether CAT Terminal is operated in 22-byte mode, so that 22 data bytes can be transferred to and from the terminal. 3 PLC cycles are still necessary for each exchange. Bps = (LB * 22/3) / T TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 29
## Page 30

Configuration The terminal is parameterized via the Co E Online tab in the Twin CAT System Manager (double-click the corresponding object). Serial PC Interface The serial physical PC interface (COM1, COM2, etc.) is handled by the Twin CAT system similarly to the serial bus terminal and Ether CAT Terminal and uses larger data transfer buffers than the serial Bus Terminal. The library uses a 64-byte buffer, so that up to 64 data bytes can be transferred simultaneously between the PLC and the interface driver. 3 PLC cycles are again needed for the exchange of a data block with the serial PC interface. Bps = (LB * 64/3) / T Virtual serial COM port The Twin CAT system also supports a virtual serial COM port (COM1, ..., COM255), which is available in Windows. In the Twin CAT/BSD operating system the COM port must register as `tty U0`...`tty U255` to be supported. No configuration of the process image in the Twin CAT System Manager is required. The parameterization takes place directly in the PLC using the function blocks provided. This communication connection is not real-time capable. The baud rate can be set between 150 baud and 128000 baud. Typical, frequently used baud rates are 9600 or 115200 baud. One port per target system The product is designed for use with a single virtual COM port per target system. However, in principle it is possible to use of several virtual COM ports on one system, provided function tests are carried out. Serial bus terminal KL6xxx in 3-byte mode The standard version of the serial Beckhoff Bus Terminal is operated in 3-byte mode. In other words, a bus telegram can transmit or receive 3 data bytes to or from the terminal. Since every data exchange between the PLC and the bus terminal requires 3 PLC cycles, the effective transfer rate is one byte per cycle. Bps = LB / T In the case of bus terminals, the K-bus update time of the bus coupler must be considered when selecting the cycle time (see Task configuration [} 22]). KL6xxx in 5-byte mode The serial bus terminal can be reprogrammed offline by means of a configuration program (Beckhoff KS2000), so that, in 5-byte mode, 5 data bytes can be transferred to or from the terminal. 3 PLC cycles are still necessary for each exchange. The effective data rate for a given cycle time of the PLC is thus 5/3 greater than in 3-byte mode. Bps = (LB * 5/3) / T The bus terminals cannot be re-programmed while the PLC is running, since the 3-byte and 5-byte modes differ in the register mapping and in the Twin CAT System Manager configuration. In the case of bus terminals, the K-bus update time of the bus coupler must be considered when selecting the cycle time (see Task configuration [} 22]). KL6xxx in 22-byte mode 30 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340
## Page 31

Configuration The serial bus terminal can be supplied with a 24-byte process image as a special type, so that 22 data bytes can be transferred to and from each terminal. 3 PLC cycles are still necessary for each exchange. Bps = (LB * 22/3) / T In the case of bus terminals, the K-bus update time of the bus coupler must be considered when selecting the cycle time (see Task configuration [} 22]). 4.3 Communication Principle Background Communication As described in the section on Supported Hardware [} 29], the maximum effective data transfer rate depends in part on the PLC cycle time. So, for example, for communication with the serial bus terminal at an effective rate of 9600 bps, a cycle time of 1 ms is required. In many larger applications such a short cycle time for the whole PLC would heavily load the control computer. Since for most applications longer cycle times of, for instance, 10 ms are more than adequate, it is possible with the aid of this library to decouple the data traffic between the PLC and the hardware from the rest of the PLC application. Two tasks are created in the PLC program for this purpose. The standard task runs with the conveniently long PLC cycle time of, for example, 10 ms, while a second communication task runs with a faster cycle taking, for example, 2 ms. TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 31
## Page 32

Configuration Data buffers of type Com Buffer [} 64] are used to decouple the different speeds of the fast communication task and the standard task. They are written and read asynchronously. The function blocks described later for receiving and sending data (Send Byte [} 40], Send String [} 42], Send Data [} 41] etc.) make use of only an additional data buffer for data exchange, and are thus independent of the hardware being used. In all cases, a communication block Serial Line Control [} 51] is called in the fast task, as well as the send and receive blocks. This handles the data traffic between the data buffer and the hardware with maximum speed in the background. If a COM port or terminal with 22 byte data interface is used a second task is not needed for low baud rates. Then the communication block Serial Line Control [} 51] can be called in the standard task. The communication with virtual COM ports via Serial Line Control ADS [} 52] uses an ADS server. Data exchange is handled asynchronously via ADS and is managed in intermediate buffers. The server itselfs receives the incoming data of the virtual COM port independent of the PLC. So the maximal effective data transfer don't depend on the PLC task cycle time. Only the reaction time for incoming data would be decreased by a faster task cycle time. The full delay can't be defined because the virtual-com-port-drivers and the ADS server do not run in realtime. The communication block Serial Line Control ADS usually is called in the standard task. A second task is not needed. 32 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340

Otherwise no data has been received. Error Com Error_t [} 74] If a fault occurs, Error will contain an error code. Sample Whenever a the function block Receive Byte is processed in a PLC task that is running slower than the communication with the hardware, it must be observed that more than one character can be made available in each PLC cycle. The characters received should therefore be read out within a loop: REPEAT Receive(RXbuffer:=RXbuffer); IF Receive. Byte Received THEN (* Zeichen auswerten *) END_IF UNTIL NOT Receive. Byte Received END_REPEAT The number of passes through the loop is inevitably limited by the size of the receive data buffer (presently 300 bytes), so that an infinite loop need not be feared.

The start and end of the data stream are recognized by various mechanisms, which can be combined with one another: • Prefix If a variable is passed to the input variable prefix, the first characters of the received data must be the same as this prefix. Other characters are discarded. If no prefix is supplied (null), the receive data starts with the first received character. • Suffix If an input variable Suffix is supplied, the input data is read until the end of the receive data agrees with the suffix. If the received data reach the maximum length Size Receive Data, a COMERROR_DATASIZEOVERRUN error is generated. • Block size If no suffix is specified, characters are received up to Size Receive Data. • Timeout If a timeout is passed to the function block, characters are received until a correspondingly large time gap follows a character. The receive data consists of the characters received up to that point. If timeout is 0, characters are received up to Size Receive Data without time monitoring. • Suffix and timeout If both a suffix and a timeout are passed, the input data is read until: ◦ the end of the receive data matches the suffix. (Data Received=TRUE) ◦ the received data reaches the maximum length Size Receive Data. (Data Received=TRUE, Error=COMERROR_DATASIZEOVERRUN) ◦ a character is followed by a correspondingly large time gap. The receive data consists of the characters received up to that point. (Data Received=TRUE, Rx Timeout=TRUE) As soon as the output Data Received becomes TRUE, the receive data is ready in the Receive Data variable.

PLC API Name Type Description Data Received BOOL Data Received becomes TRUE as soon as the receive data is valid. The output remains TRUE for precisely one cycle, which means that it is necessary to evaluate the received data immediately. Busy BOOL Busy becomes TRUE after the first character has been received, and goes FALSE as soon as the data has been received or an error or timeout has occurred. Error Com Error_t [} 74] If a fault occurs, Error will contain an error code. Rx Timeout BOOL Rx Timeout becomes TRUE if the maximum interval between two received characters is exceeded. This causes data reception to be aborted, and the characters received up to this point are available. If a suffix is not being used, then detection of a timeout does not represent a fault, but indicates the normal end of the receive data. If, on the other hand, a suffix was being used, it was not possible to receive this. The timeout is not output as an error, but is only signaled via this output. In such a case Data Received is nevertheless TRUE and Len Received Data indicates the number of data received until the timeout. To evaluate only valid and complete receive data (incl. suffix), a query should check Rx Timeout=FALSE and Error=COMERROR_NOERROR in addition to Data Received=TRUE. Len Receive Data UDINT Len Receive Data indicates the actual number of data bytes received, and can be less than or equal to Size Receive Data. If prefix or suffix are used, they are also included in the receive data and Len Receive Data thus indicates the total number of received data bytes including prefix and suffix.

## Page 53

PLC API The function block Serial Line Control ADS handles the communication between a virtual serial interface and the PLC. The function block is called cyclically, and places received data into the Rx Buffer. Data made available in the transmit buffer Tx Buffer is sent to the interface at the same time. Since the function is handled independent of the application, it is referred to as background communication. Just like the function block Serial Line Control, it can also be handled in a fast task. Normally, however, the function block can be called in the standard task and a separate second, faster task can be dispensed with. (see communication concept [} 31] and assisted hardware [} 29]). When the function block is called cyclically and the input Connect is set, the parameterized serial COM port is opened automatically. This means that this COM port is blocked for other applications. To enable the COM port for access from another application, you can reset the input Connect. The current port is then closed. If a different COM port or a different parameterization is selected in the input structure Serial Cfg [} 65], the previous port is closed automatically and the new port is opened. Inputs VAR_INPUT Connect : BOOL; (* connect to serial port [TRUE=connect, FALSE=disconnect] *) Serial Cfg : Com Serial Config; Net Id : T_Ams Net Id := ''; (* host Net Id *) Timeout : TIME := DEFAULT_ADS_TIMEOUT; (* Timeout for ADS calls *) END_VAR Name Type Description Connect BOOL To initialize a connection to a serial port, Connect TRUE must be applied to the function block. If Connect is FALSE, an opened port is closed again. Note: If a change of this input variable is executed, it can take a maximum of 6 times the timespan specified at Timeout until the action has been completely executed. Therefore, the application must pay attention to the Port Opened output and wait until it assumes the desired state. Serial Cfg Com Serial Config [} 65] This input structure defines which COM port is to be used and opened with which parameters. Net Id T_Ams Net Id To execute the query on the local device, it is not necessary to specify this input variable. Alternatively, an empty string can be specified. To direct the request to another Twin CAT target device, the corresponding AMS Net Id can be specified here. Timeout TIME Specifies a maximum duration of time for the execution of the function block. The default value is 5 seconds.

The background communication, which is handled by a separate function block Serial Line Control [} 51] decides on the hardware interface used. The associated data buffers Tx Buffer and Rx Buffer (of type Com Buffer [} 64]) are transferred to the function block P3964R. Sending Send data are entered into the send data buffer TXdata by the PLC. The number of data bytes entered is passed on in TXcount, and then TXstart is set to TRUE. While sending, TXbusy=TRUE. Once the data has been successfully transferred, TXready=TRUE. 54 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340
## Page 55

PLC API Receiving RXstart is set to TRUE to receive data. After a complete data set has been received, the RXready output goes TRUE and RXcount data bytes are ready in the receive data buffer RXdata. While receiving, RXbusy=TRUE. Interrupt reception The function block P3964R can be used in either send or receive mode. It is worthwhile switching the function block to receive when transmission is not taking place. As long as the function block is in receive mode, but no start character has been received from the remote terminal, a rising edge at TXstart can interrupt the reception and initiate the sending of data. After the transfer the function block goes into its initial state (Busy=FALSE), and is only switched over to receive by a new edge at RXstart. Priority In a 3964R data connection, each remote terminal may send at any time. If both ends attempt to send at the same time, there is a collision. In that case, the end with the lower priority goes into receive mode, while the end with the higher priority sends again. For this reason, when priority is low the output RXready=TRUE, even though data are to be sent. The data in RXdata may then require evaluation. The setting of the priority at the two ends is to be agreed.

Priority BOOL In a 3964R data connection, each remote terminal may send at any time. If both ends attempt to send at the same time, there is a collision.

PLC API 5.1.4.2 RK512 The function block RK512 basically distinguishes two operation modes, passive and active operation. In the passive mode the function block waits for and answers data telegrams from the communication partner. The communication partner can send the data blocks to the local controller, or can fetch data from it. In order for the function block RK512 to be able to accept data blocks or to return data that has been requested, it must previously be configured for passive operation by DBconfig() [} 59]. In active mode, the RK512 function block either sends data blocks to the communication partner (SEND) or fetches them from it (FETCH). As long as neither of the function block's Send or Fetch inputs switch it into active operation it waits for telegrams from communication partners, changing when appropriate into passive mode. The two operation modes can be mixed. In that case the RK512 function block attempts to synchronize the telegram traffic. Since mixed mode operation can introduce delays into the data traffic, it should be avoided if possible. One instance of the RK512 function block serves just one serial interface. It is not possible for multiple instances to handle data traffic over the same serial interface at the same time. Inputs VAR_INPUT Send : BOOL; (* SEND command *) Fetch : BOOL; (* FETCH command *) Db Adr : POINTER TO BYTE; (* ADR(DB), SEND=source, FETCH=target *) Db Size : UINT; (* SIZEOF(DB), size in byte for Send or Fetch *) Remote Db Nr : BYTE; (* SEND=target, FETCH=source *) Nr Of Bytes : UINT; (* number of bytes to send or fetch *) Byte Offset : UINT; (* byte offset in remote DB *) High Priority : BOOL; (* 3964R priority *) Swap Words : BOOL; (* swaps every two bytes in the data stream before/after transmission *) TREA : TIME; (* Timeout for answer *) END_VAR TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 57

PLC API Name Type Description Send BOOL With a positive edge at the Send input, data from the variable at the Db Adr input is sent to the communication partner where it is saved in the data block whose number is given at Remote Db Nr. Send and fetch cannot be executed at the same time. Fetch BOOL With a positive edge at the Fetch input, data from the data block Remote Db Nr is requested from the communication partner and stored in the variable at input Db Adr. Send and fetch cannot be executed at the same time. Db Adr POINTER TO BYTE Db Adr is the memory address of a PLC variable determined by the ADR function. e.g.: Db Adr := ADR( PLCvar ); The PLC variable can be of any type. An ARRAY OF WORD, for example, or a STRUCT data structure would be suitable. Data from this variable is transmitted to the communication partner with a send command, and is fetched and stored in this variable with a fetch command. Db Size UINT Db Size is the size of the PLC variable at Db Adr in bytes, determined by the SIZEOF() function. e.g.: Db Size := SIZEOF( PLCvar ); Remote Db Nr BYTE Remote Db Nr contains the number of the data block at the communication partner to which the data is to be sent or from which it is to be fetched. Nr Of Bytes UINT Nr Of Bytes contains the number of data bytes to be transferred. The number can be less than or equal to the variable size Db Size. Byte Offset UINT The Byte Offset indicated the data byte within the communication partner's data block from where the data is to be fetched or where it is to be stored. High Priority BOOL The priority is relevant to the 3964R protocol. The two communication partners should have different priorities. If it happens that the two partners transmit at the same time, there is a collision. This collision is resolved by the partner with the lower priority switching to receive mode, allowing the higher priority partner to transmit again. Swap Words BOOL Data blocks are usually organized by words. Depending on how the data words are stored in the memory, it may be necessary to swap data bytes within the transmitted words. If Swap Words is TRUE, the data bytes of each word in all the data telegrams are swapped. TREA TIME Each telegram from a communication partner is acknowledged with an answer telegram. The time required for this acknowledgement is monitored with respect to the TREA timeout period. TREA might be about 15 seconds. Inputs/outputs VAR_IN_OUT Tx Buffer : Com Buffer; Rx Buffer : Com Buffer; END_VAR Name Type Description Tx Buffer Com Buffer [} 64] The send data buffer Tx Buffer is used by the function block RK512, and is not changed by the user.

It cannot accept a new command as long as Busy remains TRUE. Busy Send Fetch BOOL Busy Send Fetch becomes TRUE as soon as a positive edge at the Send or Fetch input switches the function block into active mode. Once Busy Send Fetch has become FALSE the transmission has been completed, and either the Send Fetch Success or the Error output is set. Send Fetch Success BOOL Send Fetch Success indicates that a data transmission triggered by Send or Fetch has been successfully completed. Error BOOL Error becomes TRUE if an error occurs during a data transmission triggered by Send or Fetch. Error Id RK512_Error_t Error Id provides an error number [} 81] if an error occurs. Busy Receive BOOL Busy Receive indicates that the RK512 function block is in receive mode, i.e. in the passive operation mode. The function block changes automatically into passive mode from the idle state (Busy is FALSE) as soon as a telegram is received from the communication partner. With falling edge at Busy Receive either Receive Success or Error Rx is set. Receive Success BOOL Receive Success is set to TRUE after a data block has been successfully received from the communication partner. This signal is only relevant to passive operation. In other words, Receive Success is not set to TRUE if a data block has been actively fetched from the communication partner with Fetch. Received Db Nr BYTE As soon as Receive Success becomes TRUE, Received Db Nr indicates the number of the data block that has been received. Error Rx BOOL The Error Rx signal indicates that an error has occurred during data reception in passive mode. Error Id Rx RK512_Error_t If an error occurs in passive mode, Error Id Rx indicates the error number [} 81]. Aux RK512_Auxiliary_t Aux is a data structure containing additional error messages for diagnostic purposes. DBconfig()- Method for data block configuration The RK512 function block has two operating modes. In passive mode it receives data and request telegrams from a communication partner who is addressing data blocks by means of its data block number. Numbered data blocks are not known to IEC-1131, and therefore initially also not to Twin CAT. In Twin CAT, data blocks are variables of various types such as arrays or data structures (STRUCT). TF6340 Version: 1.7.0 59
## Page 60

PLC API In order to define a numbered data block, the method DBconfig belonging to the RK512 function block as called with all the necessary parameters during the initialisation phase. The method is called once for each data block that is to be addressed by communication partners. This configuration is not needed for the active operating mode (send and fetch). In the active operating mode variable contents can be sent to or fetched from communication partners, independently of this data block configuration. In active mode the data block number refers to the partner device, and only needs to be known there. Parameter Name Description Db Adr Db Adr is the memory address of a PLC variable that is to be defined as a data block. The address is determined using the ADR function. e. g.: Db Adr := ADR( PLCvar ); The PLC variable can be of any type. An ARRAY OF WORD, for example, or a STRUCT data structure would be suitable. Db Size Db Size is the size of the PLC variable at Db Adr in bytes, determined by the SIZEOF function. e. g. Db Size := SIZEOF( PLCvar ); Remote Db Nr Remote Db Nr contains the number of the data block at the communication partner. Tx Buffer The send data buffer Tx Buffer is of type COMbuffer. This parameter is not needed by the configuration, but must however be passed as an IN_OUT parameter. Rx Buffer The receive data buffer Rx Buffer is of type COMbuffer. This parameter is not needed by the configuration, but must however be passed as an IN_OUT parameter.

PLC API 5.2.2.4 Serial Line Control ADSErr_TO_Tc Event Entry The Serial Line Control ADSErr_TO_Tc Event Entry function converts errors that can occur in the Serial Line Control ADS [} 52] function block to an event definition. The event definition (of type Tc Event Entry) can be used to create an event with the Tc3_Event Logger PLC library and send it if required. The event text can also be queried for this event. This allows an error code to be converted into a plain text description, which often exists in several languages.

PLC API Name Description Com Port Windows operating system: Any COM port (COM1, ..., COM255) can be selected. The Windows hardware device manager indicates which number a driver (e.g. a USB-to- virtual-COM-port driver) has assigned. Twin CAT/BSD® operating system: Serial ports with the device names 'tty U0' (or 'ttyu0') to 'tty U255' (or 'ttyu255') can be chosen. The number assigned to a driver (e.g. a USB-To-Virtual-Com- Port driver) can be found in the /dev/ folder. A device name 'tty U2' (USB device) is preferred over 'ttyu2' (serial HW port). Baud rate All standard baud rates can be set, from 150 baud up to 128000 baud. The default is 9600 baud. 115200 baud is also a common transfer rate. Parity The parity check for the serial data transmission is set here. Possible values are summarized in the enumeration Com Parity_t [} 70]. Data Bits The number of data bits for the serial data transmission is set here. Possible values are 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Although complete data bytes are still transferred to the PLC buffer if the value is smaller than 8 bits, not all 8 bits of a byte are transferred via the serial interface. The most significant bits are truncated before transmission, which reduces the amount of bits per byte of data to be transmitted. This setting was mainly useful in earlier times if you knew that the most significant bits in each byte would never be used and you wanted to increase the data transfer rate. Nowadays it is rarely used, so that it is recommended to leave the number of data bits at 8 [default]. Stop Bits The number of stop bits for the serial data transmission is set here. Possible values are summarized in the enumeration Com Stop Bits_t [} 70]. RTS The 'Request to Send' signal ( = RFR 'Ready for Receiving' ) for the serial data transmission is set here. Possible values are summarized in the enumeration Com RTSCtrl_t [} 70]. DTR The 'Data Terminal Ready' signal for the serial data transmission is set here. Possible values are summarized in the enumeration Com DTRCtrl_t [} 70]. CTS The 'Clear to Send' signal for the serial data transmission is set here. If the value is TRUE, no data are sent if the CTS input signal for the data transmission is not set. DSR The 'Dataset Ready' signal for the serial data transmission is set here. If the value is TRUE, no data are sent if the DSR input signal for the data transmission is not set. If DSR is TRUE, received data bytes are ignored, if the DSR input signal for the data transmission is not set. 66 Version: 1.7.0 TF6340

PLC API Name Description Trace Level This input can be used to configure the output of messages (debug traces) by the Tc Ads Serial Comm Server. This does not affect the error messages at the output of the PLC function block Serial Line Control ADS. This is therefore an additional diagnostic option. The following trace levels are possible: None: 0 (default) Error: 1 Warning: 2 Info: 3 Verbose: 4 Noise: 5 All messages with a level less than or equal to the specified level are output. If level 'None' is selected, no messages are output. With level 'Noise', even data received at the serial port and data sent to the serial port are output in the messages. This option requires considerable system resources and should therefore only be selected for temporary testing purposes. Debug traces are used as output. Under Big Windows operating systems, error/warning/information messages are also output as log events (application log). Note: If the Debug View Windows tool (from Sys Internals) is used, the setting Capture Global Win32 must be active in order to receive the messages. Under Twin CAT/BSD operating systems the messages are stored in /var/log/ messages. Invalid parameterization Not all parameter settings for serial data transmission may be available in all cases. Some settings or combinations are not supported by the operating system (Windows, Twin CAT/BSD) or by COM port drivers or the hardware. Example: In some cases the 1.5 stop bits or the 4 data bits options, or the combination of 5 data bits & 2 stop bits are not supported. Or the baud rate may be limited to a maximum of 115200 baud. Please also check the interface description of the respective embedded PC / IPC (e.g. Interface description of the CX52x0). Further information on the parameters of a serial data transmission under Windows can be found in the Microsoft MSDN description of the DCB structure.

Examples 6 Examples The following examples were developed with different hardware. Example 1 - Tutorial The application of the library blocks is explained in the form of a Tutorial [} 18], including the sections 'Integration in a PLC program' and 'Configuration in the Twin CAT System Manager'. Reference is also made to the use of different hardware. Project https://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/1033/TF6340_Tc3_Serial_Communication/Resources/ 392132619/.zip Example 2 - Application of virtual Com ports This example can be used for different applications with virtual Com ports. Any data can be sent or received. This is not really an example but a test program for testing the communication connection to the USB device. Nevertheless, as a first step it is advisable to use a Windows terminal program to test the functionality of the Virtual Com Port driver of your device. In an application that uses a virtual Com port only the call of Serial Line Control ADS [} 52] is specific. The other serial communication calls, such as send and receive data, are identical to actual serial ports. Linking in the Twin CAT System Manager is not required. The example can be used for convenient commissioning and testing of the device. The example features a visualization.

The character delay time is the maximum time interval between the transmission of two succeeding characters. 5 16#05 P3964ERR_QVZ The acknowledgement delay time was exceeded. The other device sent an acknowledgement character (DLE = 10H) twice as the telegram was being handled. QVZ = 2 sec. The first acknowledgement is expected at the start of the transfer. The output Error State is "Wait_DLE_TXstart" in case of an error. The cause might lie with a faulty physical connection or an incorrect interface parameter. The second acknowledgement is expected after the user data has been transmitted. If an error occurs, the Error State is "Wait_DLE_TXend". In this case the cause might, for instance, be data loss, data corruption or data bytes of a data word that have become swapped (see the Swap Words input). 6 16#06 P3964ERR_WVZ The repeat delay time was exceeded. WVZ = 4 sec. In the event of an error a telegram is repeated. If the telegram is not repeated by the other device, the 3964R function block reports this error. 7 16#07 P3964ERR_WRONGB Checksum error during data reception. Each telegram CC is provided with a checksum. When the data is received, the calculated checksum is compared with the checksum that has been received. 9 16#09 P3964ERR_COMERRT Interface error when transmitting X 10 16#0A P3964ERR_COMERR Interface error when receiving RX 11 16#0B P3964ERR_NOTXDAT Parameterization error. The number of bytes that are to A be sent, Tx Count, is zero. 20 16#14 P3964ERR_NAK A telegram was refused by the other device with a negative acknowledgement (NAK). The error may occur in the following transmission states (Error State):Wait_DLE_TXstart: The local PLC initiates a telegram with a start character. The other device refuses the telegram with NAK. Wait_DLE_TXend: The other device refuses the telegram with NAK after the user data has been transmitted. In this case the cause can, for example, be a checksum error at the other device.
