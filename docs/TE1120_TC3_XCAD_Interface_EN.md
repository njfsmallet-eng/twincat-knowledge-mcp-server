Overview 2 Overview The new Twin CAT 3 XCAD interface replaces the previous version and is based on the standardized AML format, as described in more detail in Concept [} 9], but continues to support the old Beckhoff XML format. We therefore recommend using the Twin CAT 3 XCAD Interface for planning new projects. Pre-requisites • Windows 7 or higher • Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and TC XAE Shell • Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 or higher Installation The installation is carried out via the separate installer TE1120 – XAD interface. Follow the installation wizard to accomplish this. Licensing The Twin CAT 3 XCAD Interface has its own engineering license. If no license is available, initial I/O topologies and up to ten tags can be imported as a test. Bus systems supported The current version only supports Ether CAT topologies. 8 Version: 1.3 TE1120

Concept 3 Concept An efficient engineering process becomes more and more important as the complexity and level of automation of machines and systems increases. The manual transfer to a Twin CAT project of an I/O topology that you have already created within the scope of electrical planning in an ECAD tool leads to high additional costs and is a potential cause of error, especially with large topologies. The Twin CAT 3 AML data exchange, on which the new Twin CAT 3 XCAD Interface is based, therefore facilitates automated creation of a topology by importing data from the ECAD tool, which saves a great deal of time. The fundamental import and export functionality is based on the standardized exchange format Automation ML (AML for short), with whose help the topology data can be exchanged bidirectionally between the ECAD tools and Twin CAT. This is ensured by a simple and universal change management, as you can adopt changes from both directions into the respective other tool. The AML format also allows an incremental import. Therefore, you can commence with the implementation of the software and the first import of the I/O topology into Twin CAT at an early stage of the electrical planning, because further imports of the updated version are also possible later on. Differences between the versions from the ECAD tool and from Twin CAT can be compared and managed with the help of the Twin CAT Project Compare during the import. This allows you to parallelize the electrical planning and software engineering and to minimize the time required for the entire engineering process. Further information about Twin CAT 3 AML data exchange can be found in the corresponding documentation. XCAD Plugins The Twin CAT 3 XCAD interface internally uses the Twin CAT 3 AML data exchange and supplements its function with a plugin concept. This concept provides for additional functionalities to be executed both when importing and exporting the AML file via the XCAD interface. These additional functionalities make it possible to enrich the AML file on the one hand and the Twin CAT project on the other, thus generating the highest possible added value in the exchange between the ECAD software and Twin CAT. Global variables are used for information exchange between plugins. A part of these variables is provided directly by the XCAD interface, the other part is generated by the plugins. This creates dependencies between the plugins. For example, the Prepare PLC variables [} 28] plugin generates a list of PLC variables, which in turn is used as a basis in the Convert PLC variable names [} 28] plugin. If the first plugin is disabled, a corresponding warning will be displayed in the other plugin. All available plugins are listed in the XCAD Interface Options [} 21], where they can be activated and set. A description of the plugins can be found in the chapter Reference plugins [} 27]. The additional functions of the Twin CAT 3 XCAD Interface compared to Twin CAT 3 AML Data Exchange are summarized in the following table. More information about the workflow and the resulting possibilities are described in the following chapter [} 11]. Twin CAT 3 AML Data Exchange Twin CAT 3 XCAD Interface Automatic generation of the I/O topology Incremental data update Bidirectional data exchange Automatic generation of a linked GVL Renaming the channel variables Transfer of comments for the channel variables Enrichment of AML Addendum: support for the old Beckhoff XML format for import See also TE1120 Version: 1.3 9

Workflow 4 Workflow Using the plugin concept of the XCAD interface, you can enrich both the AML file and the Twin CAT project to generate the highest possible added value in the exchange between the ECAD software and Twin CAT. Each plugin can be enabled or disabled and configured as needed in the XCAD Interface Options [} 21]. The basis of the plugins is, among others, the so-called tag tables in Automation ML. They represent lists of variables (tags) that are derived on ECAD side from the information of the channels configured there. These tags are connected to the channels of the hardware components via links in the Automation ML. Enriching the I/O topology in the Twin CAT project It is possible to automatically adjust the channel variables of the I/O topology, which are associated with a tag in the Automation ML, in Twin CAT when importing the Automation ML file. This means that the standard variable names, such as "Input" for an EL1008, are replaced by the tag name. In addition, the comment of the tag can be adopted for the channel variable. This allows the user to draw conclusions about the use of the channels more easily and quickly. (Plugin: Rename channel variables [} 32]) Using the template identifier attribute in Automation ML, a preconfigured template in .xti format for one of the hardware components can also be loaded during import. In this way, certain settings that cannot otherwise be made on the ECAD side can be set automatically. Generating Twin CAT PLC project content Based on the tag tables, one or more global variable lists (GVLs) can be created in a PLC project and corresponding variables can be generated from the tags, which are assigned to the GVLs. The names of the variables are derived from the tag names and can be adapted to a valid PLC variable name using a converter, if necessary. In addition, the tag comment is written over the corresponding PLC variable. (Plugins: Convert PLC variable names [} 28], Create global PLC variable list [} 30]) These variables of the PLC project can finally be automatically linked to the corresponding channel variables of the I/O topology. (Plugin: Create PLC variable links [} 32]) Time-consuming manual linking is therefore no longer necessary. See also • Concept [} 9] 4.1 Importing topology 1. Create a new Twin CAT project. 2.
