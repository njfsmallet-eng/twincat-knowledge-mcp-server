Overview 2 Overview MATLAB® and Simulink® MATLAB® and Simulink® have become globally established environments for a wide variety of applications, even among budding engineers. There are many reasons for this development. MATLAB® and Simulink® provide environments where you can focus on the engineering task. This is perfect for didactic concepts in teaching environments and efficient in industrial applications. MATLAB®, with its numerous toolboxes, provides an ideal environment for developing algorithms and analyzing data. MATLAB® offers numerous functions for easy access to different data formats and harmonizes with the different data logging mechanisms of Twin CAT. Simulink® is focused on integrated support for Model-Based Design (MBD). This involves development, testing and verification based on a system model. The subsequent, automatic code generation for platforms such as Twin CAT represents an optimal solution for applying the tested code in production. Simulink® provides all the resources required for modeling multi-physics simulations and generating algorithms for controlling, regulating and AI. As a result, only high-quality codes tested on models are used on controllers. Technologies and products for Twin CAT 3 TE1400 Twin CAT 3 Target for Simulink® With the Twin CAT 3 Target for Simulink® it is possible to make models developed in Simulink® usable in Twin CAT 3. Various toolboxes, e.g. Sim Scape™, Stateflow™ or DSP System Toolbox™ can be integrated in Simulink®. Embedded MATLAB® function blocks are also supported. The models are automatically compiled in C/C++ code with the aid of the Simulink Coder™ and transformed into real-time capable Twin CAT objects with Twin CAT 3 Target for Simulink®. Twin CAT objects created from Simulink® have the same interfaces and properties as all other Twin CAT objects. They can be used fully in Twin CAT 3 Engineering, e.g. expand to a complete project with a PLC source code, debug and link with fieldbus devices, see the documentation TE1400 Twin CAT 3 Target for Simulink®. TE1401 Twin CAT 3 Target for MATLAB® Twin CAT 3 Target for MATLAB® enables MATLAB® functions to be used in Twin CAT 3. The functions are automatically transferred to Twin CAT objects and used seamlessly in Twin CAT 3 Engineering. The automatically generated modules can be integrated into the Twin CAT solution on the one hand as a Tc COM object and on the other hand as a PLC function block, also as part of a specially created PLC library. The inserted modules are downloaded with the complete Twin CAT project into the Twin CAT 3 runtime, where they are executed within the real-time environment like all other objects, see the documentation TE1401 Twin CAT 3 Target for MATLAB®. TE1410 Twin CAT 3 Interface for MATLAB®/Simulink® Twin CAT 3 Interface for MATLAB®/Simulink® establishes high-performance bidirectional communication between the Twin CAT runtime and MATLAB® or Simulink®. You can even use it for software-in-the-loop simulation with Simulink® during the system engineering phase. During the machine runtime you realize with this product for example: • A MATLAB® app-based human-machine interface (HMI) • A MATLAB® compiler runtime based Compute Server for e.g. predictive maintenance or parameter optimization To the documentation of the Twin CAT 3 Interface for MATLAB®/Simulink® Twin CAT basic technologies for MATLAB® and Simulink® The tools presented in the following are free of license costs and are part of the Twin CAT 3 XAE or Full Setup.

Overview The Block Diagram Viewer enables the display, debugging and parameterization of a Tc COM module via a block diagram displayed in the Twin CAT Engineering System. This tab is only available for Tc COM modules generated with Target for MATLAB® or Target for Simulink®. The export of the block diagram is optional for both targets. Block diagram [} 11] Twin CAT 3 Automation Interface The Twin CAT 3 Automation Interface is a programming interface for Twin CAT projects, i.e. you can create a configuration in the System Manager, create a PLC and insert code, and instantiate Tc COM objects without opening Twin CAT via Visual Studio or the Twin CAT XAE. This API is also available for MATLAB®, among others. Twin CAT Automation Interface: use in MATLAB® [} 26] 10 Version: 1.4.1 Twin CAT 3

Block diagram 3 Block diagram When generating a Twin CAT object from MATLAB® or Simulink®, the block diagram (Target for Simulink®) or the MATLAB® code (Target for MATLAB®) can optionally be exported as well. In this case, the block diagram or the MATLAB® code can be displayed in the Twin CAT development environment under the Block Diagram tab of the Tc COM instance: Using this control, you can navigate through the entire structure of the block diagram or view the underlying MATLAB® code, and also view and change parameter values, display signal values and curves, and debug through the module using breakpoints in debugging mode. The control is designed such that it can also be used in a separate visualization. The version number of the block diagram can be viewed by right-clicking in the control and selecting About TC3 Block Diagram. Alternatively, you can view the version number in the Windows Control Panel under Programs and Features (entry: Beckhoff Twin CAT 3 Block Diagram). Installation Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 The Twin CAT Block Diagram Setup is executed with the Twin CAT 3 XAE or Full Setup and does not have to be executed separately. The Twin CAT Block Diagram Setup is also supplied via the TE14xx Twin CAT Tools for MATLAB®. Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 Install the following workload via the Twin CAT Package Manager: Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.4.1 11

Block diagram Command line: tcpkg install Twin CAT. XAE. Block Diagram Classic 3.1 Simulink®-Tc COM If a Twin CAT object was created with the Twin CAT Target for Simulink® and the block diagram export was executed in the process, the block diagram of the Simulink® model can be displayed as a control in the Twin CAT XAE. 3.1.1 Using the block diagram The block diagram export can be configured during generation of a Tc COM module from MATLAB® or Simulink®. If the export was enabled, the block diagram can be found in the Twin CAT development environment under the "Block Diagram" tab of the module instance. Using shortcuts, drag & drop and a context menu you can navigate through the hierarchy of the Tc COM module, view parameter values, display signals values and obtain optional additional debug information. Shortcut functions: Shortcut Function Space Zoom to current size of the block diagram tab Backspace Switch to the next higher hierarchical level ESC Switch to the next higher hierarchical level CTRL + "+" Zoom in CTRL + "-" Zoom out F5 Attach Debugger (System- > Real-Time -> C++ Debugger -> Enable C++ Debugger must be activated) Context menu functions: 12 Version: 1.4.1 Twin CAT 3

Block diagram 3.1.2 Display signal curves For verification and troubleshooting it is often helpful to display signal curves. The block diagram offers the following options: Display signal curves in the block diagram The block diagram offers an option to display signal curves in a window. To this end, drag and drop a signal or block into a free area of the block diagram. Create a scope in the block diagram After the drop, a scope window opens in the block diagram. Display the scope in the block diagram Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.4.1 13

## Page 14

Block diagram The title bar of the scope window offers the following options: Close window Keep window in the foreground across all block diagram hierarchies Minimize window to the title bar Displaying the scope in the block diagram control [} 24] requires a Scope View Professional (TE1300) license. No Scope View Professional license is required in Twin CAT XAE. When creating a scope window in the block diagram for a Simulink® bus, all signals of the bus are directly displayed in the scope window. The scope window in the block diagram can be used for a quick overview. For more detailed analyzes, it is advisable to analyze the signals in a Twin CAT Measurement project. Display signal curves in Twin CAT 3 Scope If the drop is not made to the block diagram control but to an Axis Group in a Twin CAT Measurement project, the signal is added there. Add a signal in a Twin CAT 3 Scope 3.1.3 Module parameterization in the block diagram To parameterize a Tc COM instance, the parameter window can be used directly in the block diagram. In addition, the Property table can be used, which can be expanded or collapsed on the right-hand edge of the block diagram. A basic distinction is made between different parameter values: "Default", "Startup", "Online" and "Prepared" The following value types can be found in the drop-down menu of the Property table of the block diagram: • Default values are the parameter values during code generation. They are invariably stored in the module description file and enable the manufacturing settings to be restored after parameter changes. • Startup values are stored in the Twin CAT project file and downloaded to the module instance as soon as Twin CAT starts the module instance. Startup values for the input process image can also be specified in Simulink® modules. This allows the module to be started with non-zero input values, without the need for linking the inputs with other process images. Internal signals and output signals have no starting values, since they would, in any case, be overwritten in the first cycle. • Online values are only available if the module was started on the target system. They show the current parameter value in the running module. This value can also be changed during runtime. Although in this case the corresponding input field has to be enabled via the context menu, in order to prevent accidental inputs. • Prepared values can be specified whenever online values are available. They can be used to save various values, in order to write them consistently to the module. If prepared values have been specified, they are displayed in a table below the block diagram. The buttons to the right of the list can be used to download prepared values as online values and/or save them as starting value, or delete them. 14 Version: 1.4.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 15

Block diagram Parameterization in the block diagram Parameterizable blocks are marked with a yellow box in the block diagram. Double-clicking on the block or a single click on the yellow box brings up a window with the parameters that can be changed. If a value is changed, it can be applied with the following keyboard commands: CTRL + Enter Set online value directly SHIFT + Enter Set startup value Enter Set prepared value The icons in the title bar have the following functions: Close window Keep window in the foreground across all block diagram hierarchical levels Keep window open at the current block diagram hierarchical level Minimize window to title bar 3.1.4 Debug Different ways are available to find errors within a Tc COM module created with MATLAB®/Simulink®, or to analyze the behavior of the module within the overall architecture of the Twin CAT project. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.4.1 15

Block diagram Debugging in the block diagram If the block diagram was exported during generation of the Tc COM module, it can be displayed in the Twin CAT development environment and used for debugging within the corresponding module instance, for example. To do so, the block diagram uses the Microsoft Visual Studio debugger, which can be linked with the Twin CAT runtime via the Twin CAT debugger port. Attach the debugger as described in the C++ section under Debugging. Prerequisites for debugging within the block diagram are: • The C/C++ source code of the Tc COM module must be present on the engineering systems, and the Visual Studio debugger must be able to find it. Ideally, debugging should take place on the system on which the code was generated. If the module was created on another system, the associated C/C++ source code can usually be made known by integrating the Visual Studio project into the Twin CAT C++ section. The file <Model Name>.vcxproj is located in the build directory, see Which files are created automatically during code generation and publishing? • The module must have been created with the Debug configuration. When publishing takes place directly after the code generation, select the Debug setting in the Publish mechanism section under publish configuration. When publishing the module from the C++ section in Twin CAT, the debugger in the C++ node of the solution must be enabled; see C/C++ documentation, Debugging. • During code generation, the options Export block diagram and Export block diagram debug information must be enabled in the coder settings under Tc Advanced. • In the Twin CAT project, the debugger port must be enabled, as described in Twin CAT 3 C++ Enable C++ debugger. Setting breakpoints in the block diagram 1. After attaching the debugger to the Twin CAT runtime, the possible breakpoints are assigned to the blocks in the block diagram and represented as points. Clicking on the desired breakpoint activates it, so that execution of the module instance is stopped next time the associated function block is executed. The color of the point provides information about the current state of the breakpoint: • Gray: breakpoint inactive • Red: breakpoint active. The program is stopped next time this function block is executed • Yellow dot in the middle: breakpoint hit. Program execution is currently stopped at this point • Blue dot in the middle: breakpoint hit (as yellow), but in a different instance of the module. • 16 Version: 1.4.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 17

Block diagram 2. Additional information, such as the corresponding C++ code section, can be found in the tooltip for the breakpoint: Breakpoints are not always assigned to a single function block. In many cases, the functions of several blocks are consolidated in a code section or even a line in the underlying C++ code. This means that several blocks can share the same breakpoint. Therefore, activation of a breakpoint in the block diagram may also result in changes in the point display in other blocks. Evaluating exceptions If exceptions occur during processing of a Tc COM module, such as division by zero, the point at which the exception occurred can be shown in the block diagram. To this end, the Tc COM module must meet the above requirements, and the C++ debugger must be enabled in the Twin CAT project (Twin CAT 3 C++ Enable C++ debugger). After the debugger has been attached, which may be done before the exception has occurred or indeed after, the block that caused the exception is highlighted in the block diagram, provided the line of code responsible for the exception can be allocated to a block. The name of the function block is shown in red, and the function block itself is marked in bold. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.4.1 17

## Page 18

Block diagram Manual evaluation of exceptions without source code Even if the module source code is not available on the engineering system or the C++ debugger was not activated, you can highlight the error location in the block diagram once an exception has occurred. Typically, an error message will always be generated when an error occurs, indicating the source file and the line in the source code. In many cases, this information can be used to allocate an exception to a block in the block diagram. To do this, you can proceed as follows: ü A prerequisite for highlighting the error location within the block diagram is that debug information was generated (option Export block diagram debug information in the coder settings under Tc Advanced). 18 Version: 1.4.1 Twin CAT 3

Twin CAT Automation Interface: use in MATLAB® 4 Twin CAT Automation Interface: use in MATLAB® Short description of the Automation Interface Twin CAT XAE configurations can be automatically generated and edited via programming/script codes using the Twin CAT Automation Interface. The automation of a Twin CAT configuration is available thanks to so- called Automation Interfaces, which can be accessed via all COM-capable programming languages (e.g. C+ + or . NET) and also via dynamic script languages such as Windows Power Shell, Iron Python or even the (obsolete) Vbscript. Use from the MATLAB® environment is also possible. Detailed documentation of the product can be found here: Twin CAT Automation Interface Use in MATLAB® The Automation Interface can be made visible in MATLAB® through the command NET.add Assembly. This will enable you to use the interfaces (Automation Interface API) described in the product documentation. You can also find many programming samples for use from C# and Power Shell (Automation Interface Configuration). In order to simplify the entry from MATLAB® for you, you can find below a sample implementation for MATLAB® on the basis of a MATLAB® class, which you can use, modify and expand. 4.1 Sample: Tc3Automation Interface Overview The sample code consists of two m-files: • Tc3Automation Interface.m: MATLAB® class that implements several frequently used methods. • Tc3Automation Interface Guide.mlx: MATLAB live script that calls the MATLAB® class as an example. Call sample with MATLAB® The Twin CAT Tool for MATLAB® and Simulink® Setup installs the sample on your system. Call the sample with the MATLAB® Command Window: Twin CAT. Module Generator. Samples. Start('Automation Interface'). The MATLAB® script The MATLAB® script provides a sample of how you can generate a Twin CAT solution, scan the Ether CAT master for I/Os, instantiate two Tc COM modules, link them and activate the project on a target. In order to be able to run the script, the two Tc COMs used must be present in your publish directory %Twin CATDir%\\Custom Config\Modules\. For this, download the Temperature Controller sample from the TE1400 | Target for MATLAB®/Simulink®. Then copy the file folder from the directory . \TE1400Sample_Temperature Controller\_Precompiled Tc Com Modules\Actual Twin CAT versions\ into the publish directory. Run the m-file Tc3Automation Interface_Testbench.m. The latest Visual Studio instance available on your system is opened in the background and the Twin CAT solution is configured, saved and activated. The MATLAB® class The properties All variables and interfaces belonging to the instance of the class are contained in the properties of the Tc3Automation Interface class. Hence, several Twin CAT solutions can be built up in a MATLAB® script by generating an instance of the class for each solution. There are then no overlaps. The constructor function this = Tc3Automation Interface 26 Version: 1.4.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 27

Twin CAT Automation Interface: use in MATLAB® The constructor loads all necessary assemblies and, if successful, sets the Assemblies Loaded property to TRUE. The loaded assemblies are: • Env DTE and Env DTE80: libraries for the Visual Studio Core Automation. Necessary for the configuration of Visual Studio. • TCat Sys Manager Lib: Twin CAT Automation Interface library for the configuration of a Twin CAT solution in Visual Studio. • Twin CAT. Ads: ADS library, e.g. for reading and changing the XAR state. • System. Xml: library for parsing XML files. Selected methods of the class function Tc Com Object = Create Tc COM(this, Modelname) Use the MATLAB® help functions in order to view the function and the parameters of the method. A link to the Beckhoff Infosys is also offered with some methods. These refer to documentation examples from the Twin CAT Automation Interface documentation, so that you can directly view a comparison of the implementation in MATLAB®, C# and Power Shell. You can also find a link to the Beckhoff Infosys in the comment in some sections, allowing you to view the source of the information. The Create Tc COM method initially begins with the parsing of the <modelname>.tmc file, from which the Class ID, the task cycle time and the task priority are extracted with System. Xml. A corresponding Tc COM is then instantiated and one (or more) associated tasks generated with the Automation Interface. Finally, the task is/tasks are assigned to the Tc COM. function Activate On Device(this, Ams Net Id) Twin CAT ADS is used in order to query or change the current status of a Twin CAT runtime, e.g. config or run. In the Activate On Device method the XAR is initially switched to the config mode with the specified Ams Net Id and the current Twin CAT configuration is then activated and the system started. Pauses are entered between the individual steps, as this procedure may need a little time. Static methods Static methods are also available even without an instance of the class. function vs Versions = Get Installed Visual Studios A function that detects and lists the Visual Studio installations available on the system via the Register Key entries is prepared here. The implementation is limited to VS 2010 to VS 2017. Documents about this Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.4.1 27
