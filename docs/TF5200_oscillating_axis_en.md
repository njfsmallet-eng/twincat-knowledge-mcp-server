Overview 1 Overview Task Oscillating axis motions (oscillation) are used for the grinding machining process, for example. As a result of the oscillating motion, a tool (grinding disc) moves in the reverse direction across the workpiece in order to reach the final dimension with high precision and surface quality. Characteristics The essential characteristics of the oscillating motion result from the oscillating motion between two absolute positions as well as the feed rate. Parametrisation Settings are required in the channel and axis parameter lists to parameterise an oscillating motion. The section Parameter [} 16] contains a detailed description of the commands. Programming An oscillating motion is defined in the NC program by the axis-specific command X[OSC…] (see Chapter Programming [} 12]). Mandatory note on references to other documents For the sake of clarity, links to other documents and parameters are abbreviated, e.g. [PROG] for the Programming Manual or P-AXIS-00001 for an axis parameter. For technical reasons, these links only function in the Online Help (HTML5, CHM) but not in pdf files since pdfs do not support cross-linking. 8 Version: 1.031 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Oscillating axis

Description 2 Description An oscillating axis motion is required in certain machining technologies, e.g. grinding, and this is executed mainly independently of a path motion. This motion referred to below as an "oscillating motion" is executed by the tool with periodic reversal across the workpiece. In the strict physical sense of the word, a typical oscillating motion is sinusoidal. It must be borne in mind that, when the term “oscillating motion” is used for the periodic reversal motion described in this section, the timing of the motion is not generally sinusoidal. This is also not intended since in typical grinding work, the relative velocity between the disc and the workpiece should be constant, at least during tool engagement. An oscillating axis during grinding is presented in the figure below as an example. The workpiece is machined by superimposing the oscillating X motion on positioning motions in the Y and Z axes. z x Oscillating motion Grinding wheel Work piece Fig. 1: Grinding with an oscillating axis Description of parameters An oscillating motion can be described by the following parameters in addition to the profile type which defines the velocity curve in the dynamic phase. v : Oscillation feed osc T : Oscillating period osc f : Oscillating frequency (1/ T ) osc osc p1: Oscillation reversal position 1 p2: Oscillation reversal position 2 t : Waiting/delay time at oscillation reversal position 1 d1 t : Waiting/delay time at oscillation reversal position 2 d2 s : Oscillation excursion exc TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.031 9 Oscillating axis

Programming 3 Programming The programming syntax is based on the axis-specific programming of independent axes [PROG]. After the axis identifier, the parameters of the oscillating motion are defined by keywords and, if applicable, an associated value: X[<keyword> <(value1)>, [<keyword2> <(value2) >,...] The characteristic of the oscillating motion is determined by the locations of the reversal positions and the axis feed rate. The reversal positions can be either specified directly or alternatively they are determined automatically via the zero position and the excursion. The oscillation velocity must be specified. It can be defined by: • feed • frequency • period If it is not defined, Error ID 50593 is output. If no restriction occurs due to the dynamic axis characteristics, the frequency and the period are maintained exactly when the linear slope is used and maintained approximately when the non-linear slope is used. Syntax for programming an oscillation motion: <axis:name> [ OSC ON | [OFF | OFF FEED=.. | OFF INSTANT] FEED=.. | FREQ=.. | TIME=.. [1ST_POS=.. 2ND_POS=..] | [ ZERO_POS=.. EXCUR=..] [1ST_DELT=.. 2ND_DELT=..] [NBR_OSC=..] [INCL_OFFSETS] [SHORT] { \ } ] <axis_name> Name of the oscillating axis OSC Identifier for "Oscillating” function. Must always be programmed as the first keyword. ON Oscillation on. The motion is stopped at block end when a path motion is active and the oscillating motion is then commanded. OFF Oscillation off. Current oscillation cycle is finished. The oscillating axis can then move again in the coordinated motion. If the oscillating motion is stopped implicitly if it is not previously deselected when a new axis motion is programmed. OFF FEED=.. Fast oscillation stop. The current oscillation cycle is aborted and the axis moves at the specified feed rate to target position (2ND POS). The oscillating axis can then move again in the coordinated motion. OFF INSTANT Immediate oscillation stop. Axis stops immediately and can be moved again within the coordinated motion immediately. Available as of V3.1.3107.38 FEED=..

N90 X[OSC OFF FEED=5000] Restrictions of kinematic transformations When kinematic transformation (#TRAFO ON) is active, an oscillating motion is only permitted if the kinematics have a basic Cartesian structure and the oscillation direction vector lies in the z axis dir- ection of the machine. If an oscillating motion is defined by the number of oscillations, it can be aborted before the specified number of oscillations is reached by programming an oscillation stop.

Oscillating motion dynamics 4 Oscillating motion dynamics Depending on the profile type, limiting effects occur at relatively high frequency or short period or short oscillation path. This is caused by the limited axis velocities and accelerations. In this case, the real oscillation frequency or period deviates from the required programmed frequency or period. The examples listed below show the limits of motion dynamics. In general these motion profiles should be avoided since the motion velocity and therefore the machining velocity during the oscillating motion are not constant or tend to deviate lower. 4.1 Example of limitation by acceleration Limitation by acceleration Dynamic characteristics used:a_max: 1000 mm/s2v_max: 5000000µm/s %L sub_mv N1000 G01 G90 Y100 F500 N2000 Y-100 M29 %osc_7 N10 X[OSC ON 1ST_POS=-120 2ND_POS=120 FREQ=0.6] N20 LL sub_mv N30 X[OSC OFF] N180 M30 Fig. 5: Limited oscillating frequency due to axis acceleration A full oscillation requires 1.964 s. The required 1.666 s (approx. 833 cycles) are therefore not possible with the dynamic characteristics listed above due to the oscillating frequency of 0.6 Hz. 14 Version: 1.031 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Oscillating axis

The required 5 s (approx. 2500 cycles) are therefore not possible with the dynamic characteristics listed above due to the oscillating frequency of 0.2 Hz.
