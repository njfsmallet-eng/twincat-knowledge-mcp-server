Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

Overview 2 Overview The PLC library Tc3_Ether CATDiag is used for extended diagnosis of Ether CAT slaves. The function blocks FB_Read Co EDiag History and FB_Read Co EDiag History_Axis can be used to read Ether CAT slaves that support the Co E Diag History Object. System requirements Target System Win10, Win11 IPC or CX, (x86, x64, Arm®) Min. Twin CAT version 3.1.4024.57 Min. Twin CAT level TC1200 TC3 PLC Using Twin CAT 3 Eventlogger Twin CAT 3 Eventlogger must be available on the target system. The function blocks of the PLC library Tc3_Ether CATDiag depend on Twin CAT 3 Eventlogger and will not work without it. 8 Version: 1.1.0 TE1000
## Page 9

Function blocks 3 Function blocks 3.1 FB_Co E_Diag History_Read The function block FB_Read Co EDiag History can read Ether CAT slaves that support the Co E Diag History Object. The Ether CAT slave must comply with the ETG standard. The function block uses the Twin CAT 3 Eventlogger and is not functional without it. Syntax VAR_INPUT s Net Id : T_Ams Net Id; n Slave Addr : UINT; b Enable : BOOL; b Ack : BOOL; t Timeout : TIME := DEFAULT_ADS_TIMEOUT; t Read Interval : TIME := T#10S; st Options : ST_Co E_Diag History_Options; END_VAR VAR_IN_OUT a Diag History : ARRAY[*] OF ST_Co E_Diag History_Entry; END_VAR VAR_OUTPUT b Busy : BOOL; b Valid : BOOL; b Error : BOOL; hr Error Code : HRESULT; ip Error Message : I_Tc Message := fb Result; st Info : ST_Co E_Diag History_Info; END_VAR Inputs Name Type Description s Net Id T_Ams Net Id Net ID of the Ether CAT master n Slave Addr UINT Port address of the slave b Enable BOOL Pulse: the Diag History is read out once. Continuous: the Diag History is read out repeatedly (see t Read Interval). With each new edge, everything is reset. The connection is then re-established and the slave is read. b Ack BOOL All messages are acknowledged when b Ack is triggered. t Timeout TIME Timeout for the respective ADS reads/writes in the function block. The default ADS timeout here is five seconds. t Read Interval TIME Time interval between repeated reading of the slave with a permanent "b Enable" signal. The default is a time interval of 10 seconds. st Options ST_Co E_Diag History_Options Controls for handling Co E Diag History [} 14] TE1000 Version: 1.1.0 9

Function blocks Inputs/outputs Name Type Description a Diag History ARRAY[*] OF An array of any length from ST_Co E_Diag History_Entry is ST_Co E_Diag History_Entry assigned to this In-Out variable. The FB automatically adapts to the length of the array. If it is too short, older [} 13] messages in the slave's Diag History Object are ignored. If it is too long, superfluous entries are deleted. A length greater than 250 makes no sense here, as the ETG standard defines a maximum of 250 messages for the Diag History Object. Outputs Name Type Description b Busy BOOL Simple busy signal, indicates that the function block is reading a slave. b Valid BOOL The Diag History Object has been successfully read and the messages issued are valid. b Error BOOL Becomes TRUE as soon as an error situation occurs. hr Error Code HRESULT Returns an error code if the b Error output is set. ip Error Message I_Tc Message Returns detailed information if a b Error output is set. The interface pointer used here is always valid (not equal to zero) and is of the type I_Tc Message. In particular, the corresponding error is immediately visible as plain text in the PLC Online View. st Info ST_Co E_Diag History_Info Provides information from the read Ether CAT Slave Diag History Object. This includes, among other things, the [} 13] Buffer Mode used and information on the available messages. This output is only updated after a successful read operation. Requirements Twin CAT version Hardware Libraries to be integrated Twin CAT 3.1 >= Build x86, x64, Arm® Tc3_Ether CATDiag 4024.57 3.2 FB_Co E_Diag History_Read Axis The function block FB_Read Co EDiag History_Axis is a variation of the function block FB_Read Co EDiag History [} 9], which can be assigned an AXIS_REF structure instead of an address. Only messages that belong either to the device or to the specific axis are output (e.g. for an AX8206 dual-axis module). The function block uses the Twin CAT 3 Eventlogger and is not functional without it. 10 Version: 1.1.0 TE1000

If only non-acknowledged messages are in the list, these remain and the latest incoming messages are discarded. If messages are acknowledged with the function block input b Ack, they can be overwritten by new messages. 4.5 E_Co E_0x10F3_Diag History_Diag Code Type The enumeration specifies the type of Diag Code value output.

Global parameters 5 Global parameters 5.1 Diag History_Parameters These parameters are constant at runtime, but can be changed on a project-specific basis via the library manager and are saved with the project properties. They allow longer message texts or more arguments within the message texts by adjustment. Due to the large, partly internal, arrays, the size of the function block instances and also the program size may increase considerably by adjusting the parameters. Syntax VAR_GLOBAL CONSTANT // FB-internal read buffer - Max. parameters/arguments buffer size per message in bytes. // Reduce to optimize memory resources. Increase if needed. c Msg Pars Buffer Size : UINT(1..1000) := 128; // FB-internal read buffer - Max. number of messages in diag history buffer. // (ETG.1020 Norm states 250 max. possible messages. Not all Slaves hold this many messages). // Reduce to optimize memory resources. Increase if needed. c Max Msgs Buffer : UINT(1..250) := 250; // FB-internal read buffer - Max. length of message string. Reduce to optimize memory resources. // Increase if needed.
