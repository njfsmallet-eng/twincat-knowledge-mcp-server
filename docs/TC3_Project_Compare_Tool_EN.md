Introduction 2 Introduction The Twin CAT3 Project Compare Tool (Tc Project Compare) is an application program that can be used to compare and merge Twin CAT3 projects. The tool can be integrated in Visual Studio or used in stand-alone mode. If a Twin CAT3 project is managed with the help of source code control software (e.g. integrated in Visual Studio), the source control clients can be set so that they automatically call the Tc Project Compare tool in the case of comparing or merging files or projects. Further information on the configuration of source control clients can be found in the section Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control [} 14]. 8 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 9

Use of the Tc Project Compare 3 Use of the Tc Project Compare Encryption If encryption is used in the Twin CAT project, you can only use the Tc Project Compare version that is integrated in Visual Studio (see Use of the Tc Project Compare [} 10]). The following dialog appears after starting the TCProject Compare tool: With this dialog you can select the two Twin CAT projects that are to be compared. The left-hand project is the project that is being edited (into which merging takes place). The right-hand project is the project that is being used for comparison. In order to display the changes in a Twin CAT object (e.g. a POU), open the comparison for this element with a double click. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.0.1 9

## Page 10

Use of the Tc Project Compare Not all changes are visible in the PLC editors All files from Twin CAT are saved as XML. There are two different views for the PLC files. One is the display when using PLC editors, the other is an XML display. Therefore, a distinction is made for these files between content changes and formal changes. The latter can only be displayed in the XML view (see Use of the Tc Project Compare [} 11]). Content changes are indicated by displaying the name of the POU in a different color. Formal changes are indicated by a red bar in front of the name of the POU. Starting the Tc Project Compare plugin in Visual Studio To start the Tc Project Compare in Visual Studio, select the menu item Twin CAT -> Tc Project Compare. 10 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 11

Use of the Tc Project Compare For Twin CAT versions prior to 3.1.4024.0, use the menu item View -> Other Windows -> Tc Project Compare. XML comparison of Twin CAT objects All Twin CAT files are stored as XML files on the hard disk. If only formal changes have been made to a file (marked by the vertical red bar in front of the POU name), these changes are not recognizable in a comparison using the PLC editor. Formal changes are, for example, changed GUIDs of individual objects or changed Line IDs (required for breakpoint handling). These changes can only be made visible with an Xml comparison. To do this, open the context menu of the Twin CAT object (by right-clicking) and select the option Compare in Xml-Diff. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.0.1 11

## Page 12

Use of the Tc Project Compare 3.1 Starting the Project Compare tool via the command line The transfer/command line parameters of the Project Compare tool are described in the section Transfer parameters of the Tc Project Compare [} 17]: Sample: The command line call for a comparison with the Tc Project Compare of version 4020 or newer therefore looks like this: C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Components\Tc Project Compare\Tc Project Compare.exe /filel <Datei linke Seite> /filer <Datei rechte Seite> Optionally, the title that is to be displayed for the left or right side of the comparison window can be transferred with the option /dl or /dr respectively. 3.2 Defining the shortcuts The Tc Project Compare can be operated via the keyboard with the help of shortcuts. These can be viewed and adapted on the Hotkeys tab of the options. 12 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 13

Use of the Tc Project Compare Defining/changing shortcuts: 1. Open the Options dialog via the menu command Tools -> Options… 2. Select the Hotkeys tab. 3. Select the command for which you wish to change the key command. 4. Jump to the selection box in front of the Assign button with a mouse click or using the Tab key. 5. Actuate the desired shortcut. ð The shortcut is entered in the selection box. 6. Confirm your selection by clicking on OK or select a further command for which you wish to change the shortcut.

Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control 4 Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control The configuration of the Tc Project Compare can be generated from the software for use with some of the most frequently used source control clients. At the moment, these are the following clients: • Microsoft Team Foundation Server • Git • Ankh SVN Generating the configuration of these clients To generate the settings for one of the source control clients listed above, proceed as follows: 1. Open Tc Project Compare. 2. Select the menu Tools -> Configure User Tools.... 3. Click on Export Configuration. 14 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 15

Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control 4. In the following dialog, select the source control client for which the settings are to be generated from the selection box. 5. In case Git is the source control client, you can select in the following dialog whether you want the settings for the selection of the Compare Tool used to be saved globally or for the specific project. If you save them for the specific project, select the .gitconfig file from your local repository. Then confirm your selection with OK. ð The configuration has been created. Configuring other source control clients: If you use a source control client that is not listed above, you must configure the use of the Tc Project Compare in the respective source control client. To do this, use the transfer parameters listed in the section Transfer parameters of the Tc Project Compare [} 17]. Dealing with non-Twin CAT flies Some clients only allow a general compare/merge tool for all file extensions. For this reason the Twin CAT Project Compare tool offers the option to define further compare tools for special file extensions. Setting an external compare tool for file extensions: 1. Open the Tc Project Compare. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.0.1 15

## Page 16

Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control 2. Select the menu Tools -> Configure User Tools.... 3. Click on Add. 4. In the following dialog describe which file extension is used, which tool is to be called (Command line) and which transfer parameters are required for compare or merge. Confirm the settings with OK. 16 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 17

Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control 4.1 Transfer parameters of the Tc Project Compare Since not all special features of the various clients can be dealt with here, the transfer parameters of the Twin CAT Project Compare Tools are briefly described below: Transfer parameters for Twin CAT version 4020 or higher: /filel File path – left side. /filer File path, right side. /filem File path for the merged file. /dl Display name, left side. /dr Display name, right side. /sc Call via source control client. Transfer parameters for Twin CAT versions 4018 or lower: File path – left side. File path, right side. File path of merged file. /dl Display name, left side. /dr Display name, right side. /sc Call via source control client. In Project Compare tool version or lower 4018 the file paths for the left, right and merged file were determined based on the order in which they are called. The order was always left, right, merged file. Samples: Compare (Compare/Diff): Version 4018 for Plastic SCM: C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Components\Tc Project Compare\Tc Project Compare.exe "@destinationfile" "@sourcefile" /sc Version 4018 for TFS: C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Components\Tc Project Compare\Tc Project Compare.exe %2 %1 /dl %7 /dr %6 /sc Version 4020 for TFS: C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Components\Tc Project Compare\Tc Project Compare.exe /filel %2 /filer %1 /dl %7 /dr %6 /sc Merge: Version 4018 for Plastic SCM: C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Components\Tc Project Compare\Tc Project Compare.exe /dl "@destinationsymbolic" /dr "@sourcesymbolic" "@destinationfile" "@sourcefile" "@output" /sc Version 4018 for TFS: C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Components\Tc Project Compare\Tc Project Compare.exe %2 %1 %4 /dl %7 /dr %6 /sc Version 4020 for TFS: C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Components\Tc Project Compare\Tc Project Compare.exe /filel %2 /filer %1 /filem %4 /dl %7 /dr %6 /sc Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.0.1 17

Reference, user interface 5 Reference, user interface The user interface of the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool consists of the following components: 1 Menu bar 2 Toolbar 3 Toolbar of the comparison windows 4 Comparison window 5 Error list 5.1 Menu bar 5.1.1 Files Choose Files… Function: This command opens a dialog in which you can select the two files to be compared. Call: Menu Files-> Choose Files 18 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 19

Reference, user interface Merging of files is only possible in one direction In the Tc Project Compare, the merging of contents is only possible from the right-hand comparison window to the left-hand comparison window. The files must therefore be selected accordingly. If you wish to change the merging direction, swap the files using the command Switch Files. Save All Function: The command saves all changes in all opened comparison windows. Call: Menu Files -> Save all Reload Function: This command reloads the two files to be compared (e.g. after some changes have been made and saved). Call: Menu Files -> Reload Switch Files Function: This command swaps the files in the two comparison windows. In other words, the file previously opened in the left-hand comparison window will be opened in the right-hand comparison window and vice versa. Call: Menu Files -> Switch Files Exit Function: This command terminates the Tc Project Compare. Call: Menu Files -> Exit 5.1.2 Tools Expand all Function: This command expands the complete tree view in the Tc Project Compare. Call: Menu Tools -> Expand all Show Error List Function: This command shows the Error List window, in which the errors and warnings of the Tc Project Compare are displayed. Call: Menu Tools -> Show Error List Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.0.1 19

## Page 20

Reference, user interface Error list is only selectable in stand-alone mode If the Tc Project Compare is displayed integrated in Visual Studio, the Visual Studio error list is used. Configure User Tools… Function: This command opens the Configure User Tools… dialog (see Configure User Tools [} 26]). Call: Menu Tools -> Configure User Tools… Options… Function: This command opens the Options dialog (see Options [} 27]). Call: Menu Tools -> Options 5.2 Toolbar The toolbar of the Tc Project Compare provides the following commands: Select the two files to be compared. Save the changes in the current comparison window. Save all outstanding changes. Reload the two files to be compared. Expand the complete tree. Swap the sides of the two files to be compared. Open the Options dialog (see Options [} 27]). Open the Configure User Tools… dialog (see Configure User Tools [} 26]). 5.3 Comparison window The results of the comparison of the two projects/files are displayed in the comparison windows. There are three different comparison views, which are explained below. If the comparison of single files has been initiated (e.g. by command line or via the source control client), the corresponding comparison window opens directly. If two Twin CAT projects have been selected for comparison, the Tc Project Compare starts with the comparison windows of the Twin CAT 3 project (see Twin CAT3 project comparison window [} 21]). Handling the status information in the comparison windows: The status information for the current comparison is located on the left-hand side of the toolbar in the comparison windows. It indicates how many additions, deletions and changes have been found. It always refers to a comparison starting from the left-hand side, as that is the side in which contents are merged. 20 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 21

Reference, user interface Example of the status display after a comparison: Starting from this example, this would be: • No contents, which are present on the left-hand side, but not on the right-hand side. • One entry that is present on the right-hand side, but not (yet) on the left-hand side. • Once change in an entry In the comparison editors, the changes are displayed in the same colors as the status bar, so that it can immediately be seen whether an addition, deletion or change is concerned. NOTE Unwanted deletion of contents when accepting additions Additions show changes that exist on the left-hand side, i.e. on the side on which merging is to take place. Since this is the side that is currently being edited, the contents are mostly new contents of its own. How- ever, the merging (acceptance of changes) refers to the right-hand side of the comparison window. This may contain changes by third parties or in comparison with old project versions. Since merging takes place from the right-hand side to the left-hand side, the non-existence on the right-hand side of the comparison window is therefore accepted when accepting an addition. In other words, the content of an addition is deleted upon acceptance. 5.3.1 Twin CAT3 project comparison window A distinction is made in the comparison window of the Twin CAT3 project between logical (content) and formal changes. In the case of logical changes, the name of the item is displayed in red. These are changes that relate to the behavior of the machine/plant. Formal changes are indicated by a vertical red bar in front of the item name. These are changes that are important for the project handling, but have no meaning for the project in terms of content. One example of formal changes is the Line IDs. These are required to assign code lines within a POU to binary code positions of the generated runtime module. They are required to display breakpoints set in a POU in the right positions, even after code changes that do not require recompilation (e.g. comment lines or empty lines). Formal changes cannot be displayed in the PLC comparison windows; therefore, they have to be compared (if need be) in the XML comparison windows. Toolbar in the comparison editor of the Twin CAT3 project: Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.0.1 21

## Page 23

Reference, user interface Hide Items Opens the submenu Hide Items. Hide Items -> None Selection: Do not hide any items. Hide Items -> Hide equal items Selection: Hide equal items. Hide Items -> Hide equal items + formal Changes Selection: Hide equal items and items with only formal changes. Show Plc Folders Selection: Show PLC folders. With the help of the option Show Plc Folders, you can set whether the POUs are to be compared in the existing folder structure of the PLC or in an alphabetically sorted flat list. The comparison using the folder structure thus displays a change for POUs that are identical in terms of content and form, even if they are located in different folders of the PLC. Since these POUs are not "opposite" one another in the comparison windows, they are not compared in terms of content, but displayed as Addition and Deletion at the respective points. The content comparison can be initiated with the option Compare To… (see Twin CAT3 project comparison window [} 23]). However, since this assignment has to take place manually for every POU pair located in different places within the PLC folder structure, the comparison can also be initiated in a flat, alphabetically sorted list by deactivating the option Show Plc Folders. In order to merge all changes (content, formal and structural) it may therefore be useful to compare a project with the option Show Plc Folders switched on and also with it switched off. Changes when switching over the option Show Plc Folders are not recognized with- out a Reload Since the displayed status information and thus the determined changes relate to the last success- ful comparison, it is necessary to reload the project after switching over the option Show Plc Fold- ers. Otherwise a POU that has remained the same both content-wise and formally will nevertheless be recognized as changed if it is contained in two different folders. Context menu at a node in the Twin CAT project tree Compare To… Manual assignment to an object to be compared. Compare in Xml-Diff Comparison using the XML comparison. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.0.1 23

## Page 24

Reference, user interface If objects or sub-projects are renamed in the course of the project, they are displayed in the Tc Project Compare as Addition or Deletion respectively. A content or formal comparison does not take place. In order to be able to compare these objects or sub-projects with each other despite that, it is possible to force a manual assignment/manual comparison with the option Compare To…. 5.3.2 PLC comparison window Toolbar in the comparison editors: Additions Number of new elements to be added. Deletions Number of elements to be deleted. Changes Number of changes (only in the comparison editors of the PLC and XML comparison). Shows the direction in which merging takes place. Amend comparison of changes (oppose changes). Jump to the next change. Jump to the previous change. Accept selected change. Accept all changes of the selected block. Accept all changes. If code lines are not to be directly compared, it is possible to display these code lines with an offset on both sides by activating the option Oppose Changes. This makes it possible to accept the change on the right-hand side of the comparison window without overwriting the code line on the left-hand side of the comparison window. Sample: Display of a code line with the function Oppose Changes activated. 5.3.3 XML comparison window Toolbar in the comparison editors: 24 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 28

Reference, user interface In the area Automatic reload after modification, you can set whether the file/project should be reloaded after a change. Yes Reloads both files after each change. No Does not carry out an automatic reload. Always ask Following a change, asks whether a reload should be carried out. You can set the logging for the Tc Project Compare in the Log File area: Delete log if no error occurred Deletes all log files if no error has occurred. Bundle loaded files to a zip archive if error In the case of an error, the loaded files and the log files are occurred stored as a ZIP archive. The log files of the Tc Project Compare are stored in the folder %TWINCAT3DIR%Components\Tc Project Compare\Last Log. Further general settings: Multiple viewer instances Allows several instances of the individual comparison windows (with the exception of the Twin CAT3 project comparison window). Ignore read only flag Ignores the read-only flag when saving. If projects or files that are subject to source control handling are compared with one another, it can be the case – depending on the source control client – that files that are not checked out are read-only. These files can be merged despite that by activating the option Ignore read only flag. However, they won't automatically be checked out! 5.5.2 Source Control tab All properties of the Tc Project Compare that are important in the case of a call by a source control client are displayed on the Source Control tab. 28 Version: 1.0.1 Twin CAT 3
