Overview 2 Overview 2.1 Product description Twin CAT HMI is a tool for creating HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces). Like Twin CAT, it is integrated directly into Visual Studio. A graphical WYSIWYG editor is used for the configuration, i.e. no programming is required. Controls from the toolbox can be arranged on the user interface and linked with real-time variables, e.g. from the PLC or from a C++ module. User Controls can be used to graphically create and configure specific controls. Java Script developers can develop their own controls. During development, the functionality can be tested with live data from the real-time system. Modifications are also possible in this live mode. The logic of the HMI can either be implemented on the client side in Java Script or as a server extension. A server extension allows you to develop extensions in C#. Because the HMI is web-based and responsive - based on HTML5 and Java Script - the resolution and orientation adapt automatically. This allows the same page to be used for different display sizes, aspect ratios and orientations. 2.2 Scenarios The HMI can be integrated into a wide range of scenarios. In a network, different controllers can exchange their data with one or more clients. The clients can run on local PCs or Panel PCs, or on mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones. 14 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Overview Local-Client Multi-client An HMI can be configured for different resolutions and can be called up by several devices simultaneously. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 15
## Page 16

Overview Multi-runtime The Twin CAT HMI can connect several real-time systems. Twin CAT runtimes can be programmed in PLC languages, C/C++ or MATLAB®/Simulink®. Multi-protocol The Twin CAT HMI server can communicate with all Twin CAT runtimes via the ADS extension. Third-party controllers can be connected via the OPC UA extension. Additional protocols can also be integrated via the Server Extensions SDK. 16 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 17

Overview Multi-server The Twin CAT HMI server can communicate with other Twin CAT HMI servers. This enables so-called server- to-server communication. Server-to-server communication offers the possibility of exchanging any data points among the servers. This enables, for example, higher-level systems to be created. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 17
## Page 18

Overview 2.3 Architecture 2.3.1 Engineering The Twin CAT HMI integrates into the Visual Studio® development environment from Microsoft. Twin CAT3 provides the free Visual Shell, which can also be used with the Twin CAT HMI. This allows you to develop the PLC and the HMI in one tool. Twin CAT HMI Creator is an editor for graphical development of the HMI. The Twin CAT HMI framework comes with predefined controls. Communication with the Twin CAT HMI Server takes place via secure network connections. The Twin CAT HMI Server has a modular structure. HMI Server Extensions provide additional functions. Furthermore, you can develop your own customer extensions to execute non-real-time-relevant business logics centrally in the server. The Twin CAT ADS protocol (Automation Device Specification) is supported, which enables communication with all Twin CAT devices. 2.3.2 Client/Server The Twin CAT HMI is essentially based on a client-server architecture. No additional software installation is required for the Twin CAT HMI Client. It is an HTML5-capable web browser that does not require any additional extensions. The browser connects to the Twin CAT HMI server, which provides the HMI in a virtual directory (WWW root). The HMI is passed to the client via HTTP(S) protocol. The HMI project consists of content such as pages and images and the Twin CAT HMI framework, which is based on Java Script and dynamizes the web-based HMI. Among other things, the framework provides the controls and establishes a secure web socket connection (WS(S)) to the server in order to be able to communicate with it. 18 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 19

Overview The Twin CAT HMI server has a modular structure. Additional functionalities can be provided via server extensions, such as the messaging system or other protocols. The server supports the Twin CAT ADS protocol and can therefore communicate with all Twin CAT devices. Third-party systems can be connected via OPC UA extensions. 2.4 Business model The business model of the Twin CAT HMI is based on that of Twin CAT 3 XAE. All products can be unlocked via a 7-day trial license, which can be renewed at any time. Only the Twin CAT HMI server is licensed. No data points are counted. Only the simultaneous client connections (e.g. browser) and the number of active targets (controllers) are taken into account. The Twin CAT HMI Server includes a client and a target connection as standard. Additional TF20x0 packages are available for further connections. Further TF2x00 server extensions can also be licensed optionally. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 19

Quick start 4.2 HMI Engineering interface 1 Solution Explorer The Solution Explorer displays the HMI project tree. It is possible to add and manage various project types in one Solution. For example, it is possible to add a Twin CAT 3 project to the same Solution as a Twin CAT HMI project. 2 Toolbox The Toolbox contains all the available visualization elements, known as controls. These can be added to the graphic editor of the designer ⑤ by drag-and-drop. A predefined set of controls is supplied with the Twin CAT HMI. 3 Properties The Properties window displays various properties depending on the object that is selected. The selected object could be a visualization control in the graphic editor of the Designer ⑤ or the Document Outline respectively, or it could be an object in the Solution Explorer ①. If you have selected a visualization control there are three different views between which you can switch using the following buttons: The left button (wrench) displays the general view with the various properties of this control. The central button (lightning bolt) displays all available events and the right button (lock) is for viewing the access rights to this control. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 37
## Page 38

Quick start 4 Document Outline (Standard VS tool window) The Document Outline displays an overview of all the controls that have been added to the Designer ⑤. As in the graphic editor, individual elements can be selected directly in the Document Outline, for example in order to change their properties in the Properties window. Controls can also be moved in the Document Outline, for example into or out of a container. 5 Designer The Designer is the front-end development tool and is divided into two editors – a graphic editor in which controls can be added from the Toolbox ② by drag-and-drop and then changed in the Properties window ③, and a code editor. The code is generated automatically in the background and can be directly and synchronously edited. In the top right-hand corner there are two buttons ⑨ for switching between these two editors. The three buttons in the bottom right-hand corner ⑪ are used to display both editors at the same time and to select the arrangement of the windows. There are various quick-access buttons ⑩ on the right-hand side. With these buttons you can open the Document Outline ④, the Twin CAT HMI Configuration ⑥, the Twin CAT HMI Gallery Explorer ⑦ and the Twin CAT HMI Live View ⑧. 6 Twin CAT HMI Configuration The configuration is the central Twin CAT HMI tool window, where you can access all available types of symbols (e.g. server symbols, internal symbols and localizations) and the User Management settings. 7 Twin CAT HMI Gallery Explorer The Gallery Explorer contains predefined graphics that can be added directly to the graphic editor or to the Solution tree by drag-and drop. 38 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 39

Quick start 8 Twin CAT HMI Live View In the Live View the visualization can be tested directly online without having to download the changes first. It can be started as an additional tool window inside Visual Studio (left-hand tab) or in a web browser by URL link (right-hand tab). 4.3 Adding controls 1. Open the Designer. 2. Switch to the Toolbox. 3. Drag and drop a control into the graphic editor. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 39
## Page 40

Quick start 4.4 Adding events All available events can be found in the Event view of the Properties window ③, divided into four categories. • All user-specific events (e.g. change of a symbol) are listed in the "Custom" category. • All events generated by the system are listed in the "Framework" category. • All events that interact with the operator are listed in the "Operator" category. • All events that only this control has at its disposal are listed in the "Control" category. You can add a logical operation to each event that will be executed automatically if the event occurs. To add a logical operation, select one of the events and click on the pencil button: The "Actions and Conditions [} 62]" dialog opens, a graphic editor for implementing your logical operation. You can also double-click on the control to implement a standard event. In the case of a button, for example, the standard event would be "is pressed". The editor consists of a left-hand and a right-hand part. In the left-hand part, all predefined actions are available in a tree view. The right-hand part is a graphic editor into which the actions and functions can be dragged and dropped. There are four different categories in the Toolbox: • General: General actions and conditions that are not directly assigned to a control • Controls: All controls that are available within the scope. All properties are listed underneath each control. • Controls (Out of scope): These controls are not in the current scope. • Functions: Various functions that can also be used within the editor In case a special logical operation is to be used several times you can build your own templates, which can then be found later in the Toolbox under the category "Action templates [} 72]". You can manipulate the Action Templates with the menu bar of the Toolbox, e.g. add, edit, delete, copy and paste. The Action Templates dialog has the same base functions as the "Actions and Conditions" editor, plus a name box and an area for editing the template parameters. 40 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Quick start 4.5 Adding an internal variable 1. Open the configuration window [} 78]. 2. Switch to the "Internal Symbols [} 88]" tab. 3. Click on the New Symbol button , double-click on create new internal symbol or drag create new internal symbol onto the desired destination. 4. Enter the data type, a symbol name and a default value. 4.6 Creating a data binding There are three different ways to create a data binding, i.e. mapping a symbol to an entry in the Properties. Create a data binding via "Select Binding Source" 1. Select the control whose property you wish to map. 2. Open the Properties and select the correct entry. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 41
## Page 42

Quick start 3. The first way is to use the dialog Select Binding Source. To do this, click on the button to the right of the property of the entry. 4. then select Create data binding ð The window Select Binding Source opens. 42 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 43

Quick start 5. In the dialog Select Binding Source you will find all types of available symbols on the various tabs: Server symbols: all symbols that are available on the server under the ADS entry, e.g. the PLC variables. Internal symbols: all internal symbols that have been created in the Configuration [} 80] (see: Adding an internal variable [} 41]) Localizations: Localization symbols, i.e. the localized text entries that you have created in the Localization editor [} 89]. Mapped symbols: Server symbols that are already mapped and are available in the engineering (e.g. Data Binding). Controls: Each control has different properties whose values can be set or read. Creating a data binding by drag-and-drop. You can drag and drop a symbol from the Configuration ⑥ into the Properties input box: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 43
## Page 44

Quick start Creating a data binding for already mapped symbols If the symbol is already mapped, you can enter the name of the symbol directly in the Properties field. In this case an autocomplete function is available. 4.7 Navigation concept The desktop view is the start page for the application on which you can create your visualization. A good method of increasing the tidiness is to split the visualization into various parts. To do this, divide it into various content objects. These content objects can be displayed in different areas of the desktop view. For example, the visualization could be divided into three areas in the desktop view: a status bar ⑬, a content area ⑭ and a navigation bar area ⑮. Various content objects can be displayed in the content area during the runtime. The contents of the status bar area and the contents of the navigation bar area can also be changed. 4.7.1 Creating navigation 1. Switch to the Solution Explorer. 2. Add the desired number of content objects: 2.1 Right-click on the Twin CAT HMI project entry or on one of the folders. 2.2 Select Add and New Item and select Content. 3. Open the view or the content where you wish to add the navigation. 4. Add a region and buttons in order to switch between the contents. 5. Set the Target Content attribute in order to define the start content. 6. Add a Set Target Content action to the .on Pressed event of all buttons and set the corresponding content. 4.8 Change the language Localized texts are defined in the Twin CAT HMI by key/value pairs. Several translations can be added for each key. Each language can be edited in the Localization editor. 4.8.1 Adding a new language To add a new language, create a new localization object. 1. Right-click on the Localization folder. 44 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

## Page 46

Quick start 4. Select a language and click on Create ð The Localization editor starts 4.8.2 Doing translations in the Localization editor The Localization editor has a column for the key and another for the translation. You can display all available languages in the same editor. To do this, right-click on the column header and select one of the languages in the drop-down menu. In the upper area of the editor there is a toolbar that offers the following options: 46 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 47

Quick start • Export or import data to or from an Excel file • Delete entry • Drop-down menu default language • Search or delete search You can create a new entry in the red and gray shaded row with a double click. 4.8.3 Switching the language For language switching there is a special control called Localization Select [} 459]. Alternatively, you can use the Set Locale Ex [} 939]-action in the dialog "Actions and Condition [} 62]" to switch between different languages. For example, you could use two buttons to switch between two languages. The ".on Pressed" event of the buttons would be used to call the Set Local Ex action and to change the corresponding language. 4.9 User Control It is possible in a User Control to swap out part of the visualization to a new control in order to be able to reuse it more easily. This control can be designed as a general module with the help of parameter values. 4.9.1 Creating a User Control A User Control is an object type of its own. 1. Right-click on the Twin CAT HMI project or on a folder TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 47
## Page 48

Quick start 2. Select Add / New Item and User Control. 3. The User Control editor appears. It is very similar to the Designer, except that there is additionally a parameter editor (P button) on the right-hand side for quick access. 4. Drag a control out of the toolbox into the User Control editor 5. Click on P to open the Parameter editor. 6. Enter the name of the parameter in the dialog Edit/Define Parameters. The "Display Name" is generated automatically after the parameter name has been entered. 7. In the Data type column, select the data type from a drop-down menu. If the data type is a structure, select the corresponding structure type in the Options column. 48 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 49

Quick start 8. In the Bindable column, define whether the parameter may be mapped to a symbol later on. ð You can now use the newly created parameters inside the User Control with their mapping properties (see Creating a data binding [} 41]). As a simple example, the illustration below shows the properties of an added User Control whose size is 100 x 130 pixels. Two text blocks have been added to this User Control, each bound to a parameter of the type String (see ⑯). TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 49
## Page 50

Quick start The User Controls that were added to the project are now available via the Toolbox; you can add them to the Designer by drag-and-drop. The parameters have been added to the properties of the User Control and are displayed in the Properties window ⑱. If they were created as bindable it is also possible to map them to a symbol. 50 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 51

Quick start 4.10 Installing packages In versions 1.8 and 1.10, most server extensions or Twin CAT HMI controls were already included in a new HMI project. In version 1.12, the new package management based on Nu Get allows you to install only those extensions that you actually need. This allows a more flexible and modular structure of the HMI project. If, for example, you want to use recipe management or the historization of data, you have to install the corresponding Nu Get package in the project. For further details please refer to "Installing a Nu Get package [} 1035]". TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 51

Development environment 5.2 Designer The Designer is the front-end development tool of the HMI. It is divided into two editors – a graphic editor and a code editor. The code is generated automatically behind the graphic editor and can be directly edited. In the top right-hand corner there are three buttons for switching between these two editors or - if both are displayed - swapping the views. The three buttons in the bottom right-hand corner are used to display both editors at the same time and to select the arrangement of the windows (horizontal or vertical). There are various quick-access buttons on the right-hand side. With these buttons you can open the Document Outline window, the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window, the Twin CAT HMI Gallery Explorer G and the Twin CAT HMI Live View L. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 57
## Page 58

Development environment 5.2.1 Graphic editor: You can design your interface in the graphic editor of the Designer. To do this, drag controls from the Toolbox and drop them into the editor. The automatically assigned names and sizes of the controls are displayed. You can set all properties in the Properties window. If controls overlap in the editor, you can define which should be in the foreground and which in the background with a right mouse click. This changes the attribute Z-Index [} 777]) Control selection A control can be selected by mouse click. This control is additionally selected if the Ctrl key on the keyboard is pressed simultaneously. 58 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 59

Development environment It is also possible to mark several controls with a selection frame. You can draw this frame by left-clicking next to all the controls and then moving the mouse. If the Ctrl key is pressed, the frame is also drawn within a container, otherwise the container would be moved. All controls that touch the rectangular frame are selected after releasing the mouse button. If the Alt key is pressed, then only those controls that are completely enclosed are selected. Here too, it is possible to select additional controls using the Ctrl key. Positioning aid With the control trap you can align controls alongside others and lock them in position. This function can be deactivated with the Alt key. If you hold the Shift key down when moving a control, it will only be moved horizontally or vertically. If you hold the Shift key down when enlarging a control at the corner, the aspect ratio will be kept constant. If you press the Ctrl key you can copy one or more controls – even into another container. 5.2.2 HTML editor TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 59
## Page 60

Development environment In the HTML editor you can edit directly and check the code generated. Designer and HTML editor work synchronously. 5.2.3 Changing default settings In the global settings of the development environments, you can change the default settings of the Designer (e.g. highlight colors). To do this, click on the tab Tools in the menu and select the entry Options. Then navigate to the category Twin CAT - HMI Environment - Designer. There you can change the default settings of the Designer. 60 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 61

Development environment Changing the default settings of the Designer applies globally to all instances of the development environment and cannot be saved on a project-by-project basis. Available from version 1.12.742.0 5.3 Properties The Properties window displays various properties depending on the object that is selected. The selected object can be a control in the graphic editor or an object in the Solution Explorer. The name and symbol of the control are displayed in the Identifier field. If you have selected a control there are three different views between which you can switch with the following buttons: The left-hand button (wrench) displays the general view with the various properties of this control: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 61
## Page 62

Development environment The central button (lightning bolt) displays all available events: The right-hand button (lock) displays the access rights [} 856] to this control: 5.4 Actions and Conditions Editor The Actions and Conditions Editor allows you to configure control events. To open the Actions and Conditions Editor, select a control and click on the events in the Properties window. 62 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 63

Development environment There are several areas here in which various events of the control can be configured: • Framework: This covers events that are triggered from the system and concerns the life cycle of the control (init, attach, detach, destroy) as well as changes of size (resize) or movements (moved). • Operator: These are events that are triggered by the operator, for example click, double-click. • Control: Many controls trigger events. These are, for example, a change in a state symbol of a button or the time at which the loading of an image was completed. • Custom: Further events are possible here. Here, any icon can be entered or selected from the context menu. If its value changes, an action is executed. The configuration of Twin CAT Speech [} 1275] events is also possible here. Clicking the Edit icon (pen) opens the Actions and Conditions Editor for the event associated with the selected control. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 63
## Page 64

Development environment The actions are listed in the left part of the editor. The right part is a graphic editor into which the actions can be moved by dragging and dropping. The toolbox is divided into different categories: • General [} 64]: General actions and conditions that are not directly assigned to a control. • Selected Control: Properties of the selected control that can be changed during runtime. • Controls [} 70] (in scope): All available controls on the same HMI side as the control. The properties of the control that can be changed during runtime are listed below the control. • Controls (Out of scope): The controls that are not on the same HMI side as the control. • Functions [} 71]: Various functions that can also be used within the editor. • Action Templates [} 72]: Defined templates for actions that can be reused. You can perform the following actions in the Actions and Conditions Editor: Add an Action Template Edit an Action Template Delete an Action Template Copy an Action Template Expand/collapse folder 5.4.1 General The general actions can be used independently of a control. 64 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 65

Development environment 5.4.1.1 Condition A condition is an If statement within the Actions and Conditions Editor. Explanations: 1 Condition: Condition of the If statement. A Binding [} 109] to a symbol can be created. 2 Comparison operator: Comparison operator of the If statement. The selection is made via the combo box (==, !=, >=, >, <=, <). 3 Comparison value: Comparison value of the If statement. A Binding [} 109] to a symbol can be created. 4 Add a condition: Click the button to add another condition to the If statement. 5 Logical operator: Logical operator between the conditions. The selection is made via a combo box (AND, OR). 6 Remove condition: Click the button to remove a previously added condition. 7 Then branch: Then branch of the If statement that is executed if the condition is met. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 65
## Page 66

Development environment 8 Or branch: Or branch of the If statement that is executed if the condition is not met. 5.4.1.2 Switch Case A Switch Case statement refers to a case distinction within the Actions and Conditions Editor. Explanations: 1 Condition: Condition of the case distinction. A Binding [} 109] to a symbol can be created. 2 Add case: Click the button to add another case to the case distinction. 3 Case: Individual case that is compared with the condition. A Binding [} 109] to a symbol can be created. 4 Then branch: This branch is executed if the case meets the condition. 5 Remove case: Click the button to remove a previously added case. 6 Default branch: This branch is executed if no case meets the condition. 5.4.1.3 Write To Symbol The Write To Symbol action writes any value to a symbol (server symbol [} 80], internal symbol [} 88]) or to a control [} 114] property. 66 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 67

Development environment Explanations: 1 Symbol: Symbol or control property to be written to. A binding [} 109] is required. 2 Value: Value to be written to the symbol. A binding to another symbol or a control property can be created. 5.4.1.4 Java Script A Java Script action consists of Java Script code and enables the execution of simple Java Script functions. 5.4.1.5 Create Binding The Create Binding action creates a binding [} 109] to a control property at runtime. Explanations: 1 Target: The control property for which the binding is to be created. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 67
## Page 68

Development environment 2 Expression: Expression (symbol [} 80], control property [} 114] or localized text [} 89]) to be bound to the target. As of version 1.10.1336.0, this functionality is taken over by the create Binding [} 926] function. 5.4.1.6 Remove Binding The Remove Binding action removes a binding from a control property at runtime. Explanations: 1 Target: Control property from which the binding [} 109] is to be removed. From version 1.10.1336.0, this functionality is taken over by the remove Binding [} 927] function. 5.4.1.7 Comment The comment action inserts a comment in the Actions and Conditions Editor. The comment is used for information or as a structuring aid with more complex logics and is not interpreted during runtime. 68 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 69

Development environment 5.4.1.8 Feedback from actions All actions in the Actions and Conditions Editor can provide feedback on the success of the action. A "Success" and an "Error" branch can be displayed for each action by right-clicking on it. Explanations: • The "Success" branch is called if the action was executed without errors. For Java Script code containing a context object [} 1470], the context object must return "Success". • The "Error" branch is called if an exception occurs during execution of the action. For Java Script code that contains a context object, the "Error" branch is called if an exception or an "Error" message of the context object occurs. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 69
## Page 70

Development environment • With an asynchronous logic, the function "Wait for completion [} 1469]" waits for the action to be executed. With a synchronous logic, this function has no effect. 5.4.2 Controls The Actions and Conditions Editor allows you to change all control properties at runtime (similar to the static configuration in the Properties window [} 61]). In addition to the properties of the selected control, the properties of all controls instantiated within all HMI pages can be changed. The control properties of the instantiated controls are listed in the left column of the Actions and Conditions Editor. Drag & drop can be used to add the properties to the right part of the editor. Drag & drop automatically adds the control property to a Write To Symbol action. The following example shows setting the maximum value of a linear gauge [} 433] by pressing a button (on Pressed event [} 783]). 70 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 71

Development environment 5.4.3 Functions Various functions are available graphically in the Actions and Conditions Editor. In addition, user-specific functions [} 1471] are listed there according to their category. The functions can also be used in the Properties window [} 61]. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 71
## Page 72

Development environment The functions are listed in the left column of the Actions and Conditions Editor. Drag & drop can be used to add the functions to the right part of the editor. Not all functions are useful in all contexts. 5.4.4 Action Templates Action Templates allow you to reuse multiple actions that are often used together in the project. Reuse is made possible by passing on so-called template parameters. Action Templates are used like an action in the Actions and Conditions Editor. The template parameters are also transferred to the Action Template there. All the functions of the Actions and Conditions Editor are available within the Action Template. 5.4.4.1 Editor The Action Template Editor can be opened via the Actions and Conditions Editor or the Configuration window [} 78]. The editor allows you to create and edit Action Templates. The editor is structured like the Actions and Conditions Editor and contains the following extensions: Explanations: 1 Explorer: The Explorer offers the same categories as the Actions and Conditions Editor. 2 Template name: Name of the Actions Template displayed under Action Templates in the Actions and Conditions Editor. 3 Template description: Description of the Action Template that is displayed during mouseover over the Action Template in the Actions and Conditions Editor. 4 Action editor: Graphic editor that records the Actions and Conditions using drag & drop. The functionality is the same as the Actions and Conditions Editor. 5 Parameter name: Name of a Template Parameter that is passed to the Action Template. 6 Parameter data type: Data type of the Template Parameter. 7 Parameter description: Description of the Template Parameter that is displayed during mouseover over the parameter in the Actions and Conditions Editor. 8 Parameter buttons: • New: Adds a new Template Parameter. • Edit: Edits an existing Template Parameter. 72 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 73

Development environment • Remove: Removes an existing Template Parameter. • Up: Moves an existing Template Parameter up one position. • Down: Moves an existing Template Parameter down one position. 5.4.4.2 Example The following description shows the creation of an Action Template as an example. The example describes an Action Template for switching any Boolean value. 1. In the Action and Conditions Editor, click "Add Action Template". The Action Template Editor [} 72] opens. 2. Enter a name and a description for the Action Template. 3. Add a Template Parameter of type "Boolean" to the Action Template. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 73
## Page 74

Development environment 4. Drag a condition [} 65] into the editor area and implement the logic for switching the Boolean value using Write To Symbol actions [} 66]. You can insert the Template Parameter into the editor area using drag & drop. 5. The Action Template can now be used as a normal action. In the Actions and Conditions Editor, drag the Action Template into the editor area and link an icon of type "Boolean" to the template parameter. 74 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 75

Development environment 5.5 Document Outline The Document Outline shows an overview of all controls that are located on the view or content page currently open in the Designer. Individual elements can be selected directly in the Document Outline, for example in order to change their properties in the Properties window. • By clicking on you can hide individual controls so that they are no longer displayed in the Designer. The controls are still displayed in the Live View or in the browser. The controls are made visible again by clicking on . • You can lock controls to prevent them being shifted by clicking on . Clicking on unlocks the controls so that they can be shifted again. • The lightning bolt icon indicates that events are configured for this control. A click on the icon opens the Properties window and displays the events. • If controls are superimposed on one another in the Designer, thus making them inaccessible via the graphic editor, they can be selected directly via the Document Outline. • It is also possible to influence the order of the controls by drag-and-drop. (See detail page Positioning of controls [} 117]). In addition, you can shift the controls into containers or grids or remove them from a container or grid. 5.6 Live View In the Live View the current configuration of the HMI can be tested directly online with values from the PLC without the changes first having to be published on a server. The Live View can be opened directly as a tool window in Visual Studio. The Live View synchronizes itself directly with the Designer without you first having to save the changes. If, for example, you shift a control in the Designer, it will be shifted automatically in the Live View. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 75
## Page 76

Development environment The Live View toolbar offers various options: 1. HMI project for which the Live View is displayed. If there are several HMI projects in the Solution, you can switch between the various projects. 2. Refresh button: Refreshes the Live View when changes have been made in the Designer that couldn't be automatically refreshed. 3. Developer Tools button: Opens the Developer Tools [} 1600] of the browser engine. These can be used for debugging purposes: 76 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Adding a new language entry To create a new localization entry, click in the last row of the table on create new localized symbol. A unique key must exist for each entry. Further languages can be displayed via the context menu of the table. 108 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 109

Development environment It is not possible to edit the additionally displayed language in this table. To do that you have to open the respective table for the language. In the Designer you can link the language key directly to the property of a control as a symbol. The language symbols are marked by an "L". When hovering with the mouse pointer over a language symbol, the corresponding language entries are displayed. 5.9 Symbols and Bindings A binding links any symbol to a property [} 61] of a control. A binding automatically updates the property of the control when the value of the symbol changes. 5.9.1 Create binding Under Properties [} 61] you can configure a binding by clicking the symbol. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 109
## Page 110

Development environment The Select Binding Source dialog displays all available symbols, categorized by symbol type. Server symbols must be mapped before they are bound to a control property. The mapping is created by clicking the Map Symbol or automatically by clicking OK. The mapped server symbols are available under Mapped symbols after the mapping has been created. Besides internal variables and localization symbols, properties of other controls can also be bound (e.g. the current text of a text box [} 640]). 110 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 111

Development environment Alternatively, the symbols in input fields can be bound directly to a property of a control using auto- completion. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 111
## Page 112

Development environment Available from version 1.10. 5.9.2 Create function binding In addition to variable bindings, a function binding can be created. A function binding can be created for all control properties, if the Java Script functions return a suitable value for the property of the control. A function binding can be used for conversions [} 1474], for example. A function binding is created with the Create function binding command. An active function binding is identified by fx highlighted in blue. The parameter values of the function are transferred directly in the Properties window. In addition, it is possible to implement custom Java Script functions and create a function binding for them. Further information can be found here [} 1471]. 5.9.3 Configure binding A binding created for a property of a control can be configured via the Edit Binding dialog. The dialog can be opened by right-clicking or double-clicking on the bound symbol. 112 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 113

Development environment The Edit Binding dialog offers various configuration options, depending on the symbol type: 1 Binding mode: Binding mode determines whether the binding acts in one direction or in both directions. • One-way binding (read-only): The value of the symbol is read. • Two-way binding (read and write access): The value of the symbol is read and the symbol is written when a specific event is triggered. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 113
## Page 114

Development environment 2 Binding event: The binding event can only be optionally configured for Two Way bindings. It determines at which event the symbol is written to (e.g. on Value Changed [} 457] for a linear gauge [} 433]). If no event is selected for a Two Way binding, the value is automatically written back if the value changes. • Event: An event of the current control for which the symbol is to be written to. 3 Interval: The interval specifies the time within which the binding is to be queried or updated. The interval can only be set for server symbols. • Time (ms): Time in milliseconds. 4 Timeout: The timeout defines the time after which a read or write access to the symbol leads to an error if no response is sent from the server. The timeout can only be set for server symbols. • Time (ms): Time in milliseconds. 5 Subscription Mode: Update mode between server and client. • Use project default: The global setting is used, which is defined in the project properties. [} 54] • Change: The client is only informed of changes to the symbol value. • Poll: The client receives the symbol value cyclically, even if no value change has taken place. 6 Parallel: This property defines whether a command is to be executed by the server in parallel or in a queue. The decision whether processing is to take place in parallel or in a queue depends on the respective application. By default, all commands are executed in a queue. This property can only be set for server symbols. • Parallel (disabled): All commands to the server are queued and processed one after the other. Execution may take a little longer if there are several commands in the queue. • Parallel (enabled): The commands are sent directly to the server without being queued. The commands are executed directly. With this option, it can happen that the execution order of commands sent in short succession is switched. Available from version 1.10. 5.10 Controls A predefined set of controls is supplied in the toolbox with the Twin CAT HMI: 114 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

## Page 117

Development environment Rights The rights management [} 856] for each control can be found in the Properties under the icon . 5.10.1 General configuration Various generally valid configurations or editors are described in this chapter. 5.10.1.1 Positioning and calculation of the size of controls The Twin CAT HMI offers various options for the positioning and calculation of the size of controls. In general, each control is always defined by its position inside its container. In the standard settings these are the values for Left [} 761] and Top [} 762] combined with Width [} 762] and Height [} 763]. These four values are specified in the unit pixel (px). If percent (%) is specified as the unit for these values, then the size of the parent control is used as a reference. A control with 50% width is thus half as wide as its parent control. The influence of the different attributes on the size of the control is defined with the aid of the attributes Width Mode [} 763] or Height Mode [} 764]. All controls have the Value and Parent modes. Many controls additionally offer the Content mode. The attributes necessary for the modes are listed in the following tables. The various separators have the following meanings: • ‚,‘: both attributes can be used. • ‚&‘: both attributes must be used. • ‚|‘: one of the two attributes must be used. Value (Standard) Width, Height Left, Right Top, Bottom Parent - Left & Right Top & Bottom Content - Left | Right Top | Bottom Value The Value mode is configured as the default together with the aforementioned attributes Left, Top, Width and Height. However, an arbitrary combination of any two of the three possible attributes in the horizontal and vertical direction is possible in order to define the position and size of a control: • Left [} 761] (including Left Unit [} 761]) • Width [} 762] (including Width Unit [} 763]) • Right [} 764] (including Right Unit [} 765]) TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 117
## Page 118

Development environment and • Top [} 762] (including Top Unit [} 762]) • Height [} 763] (including Height Unit [} 764]) • Bottom [} 765] (including Bottom Unit [} 766]) If values are configured for all three variables per direction, the last one in this list (i.e. Right or Bottom respectively) is discarded. If only one variable is configured per direction for a control, it cannot be displayed! Parent The attributes Width and Height are ignored in the Parent mode. The size of the control depends on the size of the parent control. In addition, the distances to the edges of the parent control must be defined by the attribute pairs Left, Right and Top, Bottom. After changing the mode from Value to Parent, therefore, all four attributes must be configured so that the control is displayed. Content Most container controls additionally have the Content mode. The attributes Width and Height are ignored here too. The size of the control depends on the size of the child control. In this mode, therefore, the control is just large enough so that every child control is fully visible. Here are some examples of this mode: • If the only child control is configured with Left = 10 px and Width = 200 px, then the container control is given the width 210 px. • If the only child control is configured with Right = 20 px and Width = 200 px, then the container control is given the width 220 px. • If the only child control is configured with Left = 30 px and Right = 20 px and no Width, then the container control is given the width 50 px and the child control has no width. • If the only child control has Left = 100 px and Width = 50%, then the parent element would only have a size of 100 px. • If a child control itself is aligned exclusively to the parent control (e.g. it has Left = 10% and Width = 50%), then it is skipped in the size adjustment of the parent control. If there are otherwise no child controls, the container control has the width 0 px and thus cannot be displayed! Minimum / Maximum Width / Height In addition, a minimum and maximum size can be defined for each control in the horizontal and vertical directions. The attributes Minimum Width [} 775] (including Minimum Width Unit [} 775]), Maximum Width [} 774] (including Maximum Width Unit [} 775]) or Minimum Height [} 773] (including Minimum Height Unit [} 773]) and Maximum Height [} 774] (including Maximum Height Unit [} 774]) respectively are responsible for this. Priority: calculated size > calculated maximum value > calculated minimum value A set maximum value thus overwrites the calculated size, but a set minimum value overwrites the maximum value. For example, this allows the height of the View [} 850] to be adapted to the contents (Width Mode=Content), but at the same time the minimum height can be set to 100% so that, for example, no area is created without a background image. Overlapping If two controls (partly) occupy the same area on the screen, then the order will be observed. This order can be changed by drag & drop within the Document Outline [} 75] or directly in the HTML source code [} 59]. The Z-Index [} 777] attribute offers additional options. This can assume negative numeric values and has the default value 0. A control with a higher numerical value in this attribute will be drawn "further forward", i.e. in case of doubt it conceals a control with a lower numerical value. It must be noted that the Z-index also has no global meaning, but is valid only inside a container. 118 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 119

Development environment Overfilling A container control [} 791] groups together any child controls. The container must be large enough to accept all child controls, because any overfilling will be cut off. 5.10.1.2 Color editor You can define any desired color using the color editor embedded in the Properties window. To do this, first select the color to be modified from the Colors category and you can then choose between the four following definition options: Theme: The color defined by the theme will be used. None: No color will be used. Solid: A uniform color will be used. Gradient: A color with a color gradient will be used. The color editor shown in the following picture is used to define a color as "solid". On the right-hand side you will find the entries R (Red), G (Green), B (Blue) and A (Alpha). Here you can directly enter the color via the color components and the Alpha factor, which specifies the transparency. Underneath that is a further box in which you can also define the color by means of its corresponding hexadecimal color code. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 119
## Page 120

Development environment A color selection editor is offered on the left-hand side. In the right-hand part of this editor you can select a color to use as the basis. In the main part you can then adjust this color again. In addition it is possible using the pipette symbol to select a color, for example from an image opened in an external tool. Underneath the color selection editor there is a further bar in which the last-used color is offered on the left-hand side and the currently selected color on the right-hand side. If the Gradient tab is selected, the editor described above is extended by the setting options for a color gradient. The color gradient is initially displayed in a bar. By selecting its left or right marker you can change the color with which the gradient starts or ends. The start and end of the color gradient can be adjusted via the position of the markers. This information can additionally be defined in percent in the right box underneath. In addition there is a slider on the left under the color gradient bar which can be used to change the angle with which the gradient is displayed. 5.10.1.3 Transformation editor Six different types of transformation can be defined with this dialog: • Translate: Translate in X-, Y-, Z-direction • Rotate: Rotate by an angle around an axis defined by a vector (X, Y, Z) – the default value of the vector is (0, 0, 1). The vector thus points out of the screen in the Z-axis direction. • Scale: Zoom in the X, Y, Z direction, in each case by a factor • Skew: Skewed display of the horizontal and vertical sides, in each case by an angle • Origin: Set the origin (X, Y, Z) of the transformation relative to the position of the control 120 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Change the column settings for the "Src Columns [} 246]" attribute in the "Data" category using the Column Definitions dialog [} 228]. 4. Remove the default columns. 5. Add a new column of type "Simple Column Definition". 6. The column can then be configured. For an array of a structure, you can proceed as follows: 1. Add a data grid to the interface. 2. Link the desired array with the attribute "Src Data [} 246]" of the category "Data". 3. Change the column settings for the "Src Columns [} 246]" attribute in the "Data" category using the Column Definitions dialog [} 228]. 4. Define the desired number of columns of type "Column Definitnion" and their order. 5. Adjust the settings of each column; the "Name" attribute must correspond to the name of the structure element of the array that is to be displayed in this column. The definition of the "Name" attribute is case-sensitive. For nested structures, you can use "::" as a separator to access the sub-elements of the structure, for example, "my Struct::my Struct Member". In order for changes in the data grid to be written back to the controller, the following steps must be performed: 1. Go to the Events page of the Properties window. 2. Configure the ".on Data Changed [} 251]" event. 3. Add a "Write To Symbol [} 66]" action. 4. Link the first parameter to your array. 5.

To do this, the attribute is configured with a user-defined function that takes the contents of a single table row and returns an array of strings that are set as CSS classes on the respective row element. Using a custom CSS file or theme, these classes can be used to customize the look of the table. Schema: tchmi:framework#/definitions/Function Origin: Datagrid [} 219] See also Attribute getter: get Row Classes Provider Attribute setter: set Row Classes Provider Available from version 1.10 Sample To use this attribute, a new function must first be added to the project. To do this, right-click on the desired folder in your project and select "Add" > "New Item...". In the "Add New Item" dialog, select the "Function (Type Script)" template, name the new function, and click Add. In the Solution Explorer of your project you will 248 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 249

Development environment now find two new files, one with the extension ".ts" which contains the code of the function and below it one with the extension ".function.json" which defines the function parameters, the type of the return value and further metadata. Double-click it to open the dialog for configuring the function. A function to be used as Row Classes Provider must return an array of strings and accept three parameters: 1. The value of the table row, i.e. the individual values contained in the array set as the value for the Src Data [} 246] attribute, or bound to the Data Symbol [} 235] attribute. If a data type for the row values exists, it can be used here, otherwise use the type "tchmi:general#/definitions/Any". 2. The 0-based index of the table row in the original array. This parameter is of type "Integer" 3. The row number of the row in the table. The row number is 0-based and is not affected by the Row Numbers Start Number [} 250] attribute. However, it may differ from the index in the original array if the data in the data grid is sorted or filtered. So configure the function as follows: Then you can program the function itself. For this sample, a data grid is used that still contains the default values for Src Data and Columns that were applied when the control was created. The goal is to color every second row light gray, as well as highlight every cell that contains an active checkbox in green. The following code is used for this purpose: export function My Row Classes Provider( row Value: { Test1: string; Test2: number; Test3: boolean; Test4: string; }, data Index: number, row Number: number ) { const classes: string[] = []; if (row Number % 2 === 1) { classes.push('odd'); } if (row Value. Test3) { classes.push('active'); } return classes; } TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 249
## Page 250

Development environment Since no Type Script type exists for the default value of the data, the inline type is defined here. Of course, if there is an existing Type Script type, that can be used as well. Otherwise, the code is simple. The conditions for which CSS classes are to be set are checked one after the other, the corresponding classes are added to an array and this is finally returned. To use these CSS classes now, a new stylesheet file must be added to the project. In this the classes can be used as follows: . Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Datagrid tr.odd td. Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Datagrid-template-cell { background-color: #ededed; } . Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Datagrid tr.active td[data-column-name="Test3"] { background-color: green; } The class . Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Datagrid restricts the application of style rules to data grid controls. The CSS classes defined in the function are now addressed with tr.odd or tr.active. td. Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Datagrid-template-cell selects all cells. If the class were omitted and only td was used, the cells of the row numbers would also be addressed. td[data-column- name="Test3"] selects only the cells where the "Test3" field of the data is displayed. The result then looks like this: The Row Classes Provider function is automatically re-executed each time the data is changed. So if you check or uncheck a checkbox in this datagrid, the coloring of the cell will be updated immediately. In this sample, only the background color of the cells is adjusted, but of course a whole range of other CSS properties can also be used to change the typeface or integrate background images, for example. 5.10.2.7.3.48 Row Numbers Start Number Start value of the series numbering.

An entry is added for each column. The column name is specified via the combo box, where you can select a column from all available columns [} 296]. 294 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 295

Development environment The Columns Editor consists of the following areas: 1. Type: The type of column indicates whether it is a normal "Column" or a "Custom Column". The selection of the column type can be made via the lower combo box (1). The parameters of the parameter object of an event can be displayed in a custom column. 2. Column Name: The name of the column to be displayed. For a column of type "Column", the names can be selected via the combo box. For a column of type "Custom Column" the parameters are displayed with the keyword "params::" (without quotation marks) and the name of the parameter in camel Case. Using the example of the Event Logger, the "Source Name" can be displayed in a column, for example: The parameter object can differ for different event sources. If an event does not have the parameter in the parameter object configured in the column, an empty entry is displayed in the corresponding cell. 3. Width: The width of the column. If no value is specified, the width is set automatically. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 295

Define the y-axes of the coordinate system using the "YAxis Definitions [} 415]" dialog 1.1. Define the desired number of Y-axes and their sequence. 1.2. Adjust the settings of the Y-axis/axes if necessary. 2. Link the array containing the data points to the attribute "Line Graph Data" of the category "Common". The array must have two dimensions. This also applies if only one graph is stored in this array. In the latter case the array should be declared as array[1..1, 1..100] OF ST_Point. a Points : ARRAY[1..2, 1..100] OF ST_Point; TYPE ST_Point : STRUCT x : INT; y : INT; END_STRUCT END_TYPE The structure elements must be named identically to the attributes defined on the Twin CAT HMI side. Upper and lower case is taken into account. Since version 1.12.760 it is also possible to configure the following data types: • number[] • number[][] 3. Add a graph description for each of the graphs contained in the array to the "Line Graph Descriptions" attribute of the "Common" category using the "Line Graph Description Definition [} 414]" editor.

Available from version 1.10 See also API reference for this control 5.10.2.46.1 Configuration A Trend Line Chart can be configured as follows: 1. Define the Y-axes of the coordinate system with the help of the dialog "YAxis Definitions" of the attribute "YAxis [} 726]". 1.1. Define the desired number of Y-axes to which the symbols in the following are to be assigned. 1.2. Adjust the settings of the Y-axis/axes if necessary. 2. Define the variables to be displayed in the trend element using the attribute "Line Graph Descriptions [} 710]" from the "Common" category. 2.1. Add a Line Graph Description for each of the variables. 2.2. Select the appropriate variable in each description under "Symbol". It is only possible to select variables for which historization has been activated beforehand. 2.3. Under "Y-Axis ID", select the Y-axis to which the symbol is to be assigned. If you don't select a Y-axis, an automatically scaling Y-axis bearing the name of the symbol will be generated. 3. Adapt the start [} 716] and end [} 708] point of the period to be observed. Example: Last ten minutes in the past: 3.1. Set the value of the attribute "Start [} 716]" of the category "Common" to "PT10M". 4. Adapt the X-axis scaling by setting the attribute "XMain Tick Steps [} 725]" of the category "X-Axis" to "5". 5. Activate the attribute "Show Menubar [} 714]" of the category "Menubar". Example: Trend Line Chart [} 1586] 5.10.2.46.2 Dialogs 5.10.2.46.2.1 Line Graph Description dialog The settings of the graphs and their assignment to the individual symbols that are to be displayed in the Trend Line Chart can be changed with this dialog.

Development environment Behavior in the life cycle A view control can behave differently during its life cycle. If you select the view file in the project tree, you can select the following settings: Preload: Defines whether the file should be loaded and compiled during initialization to speed up later use. The default value False increases the speed of the initial loading process of the HMI, but can lead to a reduction in the loading speed of individual HMI pages on which many controls are instantiated. Memory consumption is also reduced because the pages are no longer in memory when they are not active. Keep Alive: Defines whether the compilation result should be saved temporarily after the first use in order to speed up subsequent use. The default value is False. If this option is enabled, the controls are kept in the browser cache. This increases the loading speed of a single HMI page if it is called several times. The controls of a page are created when the page is accessed for the first time. They are retained when the page is exited. This only slightly increases memory consumption, since only those pages remain in memory that were enabled once. Pages with Keep Alive are therefore kept in memory similar to Preload when they are no longer needed. In contrast, these pages are not loaded initially. This ensures fast loading of the entire application. Load Sync: Defines whether the content should be loaded synchronously. The default value is False. Preload Bindings: Defines whether bindings to controls in this file should be preloaded before the content is displayed in order to have correct values when displaying the content. Requires that Preload is enabled. The default value is False. Please also note the background information on the life cycle [} 1557] for control development.

With the help of the grid, parts of the page or the entire page can be divided into various cells. On the basis of the cells you can then design the page by adding controls to the various cells and defining the behavior of the cells when changing the browser size. The grid offers a great many different configuration options. You can find the description of an example configuration in the chapter Configuration [} 807]. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 801

Development environment Container Control [} 784] Grid Nu Get package: Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Framework Nu Get packages are available from version 1.12. Available from version 1.10 See also API reference for this control 5.10.3.5.1 Configuration A grid control can be configured in different ways. An example configuration of the Desktop.view together with a grid control is explained below. Prior to this you should read the chapter on Positioning and calculation of the size of controls [} 117] as the basis for this example. 1. Create a new project. 2. Open the Desktop.view. The Desktop.view has a fixed size as a default setting. If the browser size changes, therefore, the Desktop.view and its contents do not adapt themselves. In the following steps the view will be adjusted so that it changes its size dynamically with the browser size. 3. Select the view. 4. Change the "Width" attribute to 100 %. With this setting the size of the view adapts itself automatically to the size of the browser. The viewport of the graphic editor can now be used to simulate a desired browser size and test the effect on the visualization. 5. Add a grid control to the interface. 6. Change the following attributes: Left = 20 px, Top = 100 px, Right = 20 px. 7. Select the "Parent" mode for the "Width Mode" attribute. With these settings the size of the grid control adapts itself to the size of the parent element accordingly. In this case the parent element is the Desktop.view. 8. Insert a second column with the help of the "Column Options [} 810]" dialog. 9. Insert a text block in each column by drag and drop. 10. Change the position of both controls to: Left = 120, Top = 140 With these settings the right-hand cell will be shifted automatically to the row below if there is insufficient space in the browser to display both side by side. You can test this function by changing the width of the integrated Live View [} 75] window or the browser instance. So far the grid has not adapted itself automatically in height. The consequence of this is that only half of each of the two text blocks is displayed if the right-hand cell is displayed in the second row. 11. Select the "Content" mode in the "Height Mode" attribute of the grid control. 12. Also select the "Content" mode in the "Height Mode" attribute of the view. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 807
## Page 808

Development environment With these settings not only will the grid be enlarged according to its contents, but also the view. In this way you can ensure that all contents are displayed so as to be reachable if the right-hand cell jumps to the row below. In order to be able to distinguish better between the two cells, their background colors will be set in the following. 13. Insert two cells with the help of the "Cell Options [} 808]" dialog. 14. Change the first cell option to: Background Color = #FFCA0000, Column Index = 0, Row Index = 0 15. Change the second cell option to: Background Color = #FFFFFF00, Column Index = 1, Row Index = 0 At the moment, both cells close and thus the entire row are bordering the lowermost control. In the row settings, for example, a minimum row height can be specified. 16. Change the "Row Min Height" attribute of the row option to 300 px with the help of the "Row Options [} 810]" dialog. If the browser height is larger than the grid, a white border will be displayed at the moment. To make sure that the visu completely fills the browser with each browser size, the following step must be carried out. 17. Change the "Minimum Height" attribute of the view to 100 %. In summary, you have created your first visualization with the help of the grid control according to the responsive design approach. This visualization fills the entire browser regardless of the browser size. If insufficient width is available, the content of the second column is automatically displayed in the row below. If on the other hand the height is insufficient, it will be expanded automatically according to the content to be displayed.

Development environment Behavior in the life cycle A view control can behave differently during its life cycle. If you select the view file in the project tree, you can select the following settings: Preload: Defines whether the file should be loaded and compiled during initialization to speed up later use. The default value False increases the speed of the initial loading process of the HMI, but can lead to a reduction in the loading speed of individual HMI pages on which many controls are instantiated. Memory consumption is also reduced because the pages are no longer in memory when they are not active. Keep Alive: Defines whether the compilation result should be saved temporarily after the first use in order to speed up subsequent use. The default value is False. If this option is enabled, the controls are kept in the browser cache. This increases the loading speed of a single HMI page if it is called several times. The controls of a page are created when the page is accessed for the first time. They are retained when the page is exited. This only slightly increases memory consumption, since only those pages remain in memory that were enabled once. Pages with Keep Alive are therefore kept in memory similar to Preload when they are no longer needed. In contrast, these pages are not loaded initially. This ensures fast loading of the entire application. Preload Bindings: Defines whether bindings to controls in this file should be preloaded before the content is displayed in order to have correct values when displaying the content. Requires that Preload is enabled. The default value is False. Please also note the background information on the life cycle [} 1557] for control development.

User management 6 User management User management in Twin CAT HMI is an authorization system for controlling user group-specific access at control, symbol or file level. The use of the user management is optional and only works with active authentication. Since user management only works when authentication is active, the configured functions are not available in live view. 6.1 Users and user groups The Twin CAT HMI User Management is based on a user group concept. The user groups are managed centrally in the Twin CAT HMI Server (Tc Hmi Srv). The actual users, who may be members of one or more user groups, are made available as a data source by the server extension Tc Hmi Usermanagement. The creation and editing of users and user groups takes place within the development environment via the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window under the category Users and Groups, within which the individual Users and Groups are listed. 6.1.1 Create new user 1. Select Create new user with a right mouse click on Users, or the Create User function with a left mouse click. 964 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 965

User management 2. Configure the user via the following properties in the Create / edit user dialog. • User name: Unique name of the user. • Password: Password of the new user for the login. Empty passwords are not allowed. • Confirm Password: Confirm password. • Authenticate by client certificate: Selection of a client certificate, [} 987] if available, which is assigned to the user. This makes it possible for a user to log on using a client certificate. • Auth Extension: Server extension that manages the authentication of the user. By default, the Tc Hmi User Management extension is selected. The developer can develop his own authentication extension to provide his own user management. • Member of the following groups: Group membership of the user. A selection from the existing groups is possible. A user can be a member of several groups. By default, the user is a member of the system group "__System Users". • Language: Language of the user. The language can be taken from the project properties or the browser default or can be defined individually. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 965
## Page 966

User management • Time zone: Time zone in which the user is located. By assigning the time zone, it is possible to localize the times displayed on the HMI. The time zone can be taken from the project properties or the browser default or can be defined individually. • Time format locale: Time format to be displayed to the user. By assigning the time format, it is possible to format the times displayed on the HMI. The time format can be taken from the project properties or the browser default or can be defined individually. • Auto-Logout Time: Time of inactivity of the user after which the user is automatically logged out on the HMI (client side) without any user interaction. Confirm your settings with OK. The settings "Authenticate by client certificate", "Auth Extension", "Time zone" and "Time format local" are available as of version 1.10.1336.0 6.1.2 Changing user properties 1. Double-click on the user whose properties you wish to change or right-click on Edit user. 2. Make the desired changes (see Create new user [} 964]). 6.1.3 Activate auto-login user Enabling the auto-login function allows a specific user to log in automatically without authentication. This skips the login page and logs in a user with preconfigured rights. If the auto-login function is activated, the auto-login user cannot be logged out. As soon as another user is logged out, the auto-login user is logged in automatically. The Auto Login function is activated in the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window under the Users item. To do this, the checkbox for a user must be set. The auto login function can only be activated for one user and not for several users at the same time. 966 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

System user groups __System Administrators: System administrator group with unrestricted rights and the following default settings: • Symbol Access: Read/Write • File Access: Read/Write • Enabled: True • Members: __System Administrator __System Guests: Guest group with restricted rights, which allow only the login function, and the following default settings: • Symbol Access: None • File Access: None • Enabled: True • Members: __System Guest __System Users: User group with restricted rights that allow access to all system server symbols required at runtime. The user group has the following default settings: • Symbol Access: None • File Access: Read/Write • Enabled: True • Members: Every user except __System Administrator or __System Guest By default, all new users are members of the group __System Users as a minimum. This behavior can be changed on the server configuration page under "Tc Hmi Srv/Security" under the name "Default Usergroup". The system users and system user groups are visible and configurable only in Advanced Mode. Do not change any settings in the system user groups. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 969

User management 6.2 Permissions system You can issue user group-specific permissions at three levels in the permissions system of the Twin CAT HMI User Management. 1. The control level [} 970] represents the client-side permissions system of the Twin CAT HMI Framework. This is a manipulation of the user interface through the hiding of controls or the deactivation of their functions, depending on which group(s) the logged-in user belongs to. 2. The symbol level [} 974] controls the user group-specific access to server symbols (mapped symbols). 3. The file level [} 976] enables the user group-specific access to the files made available by the Twin CAT HMI Server. While level one is purely a manipulation of the user interface on the client side, the second and third levels offer real data security on the server side. In order to be able to configure the rights of the system user groups at the individual levels, you have to activate Advanced Mode in the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window. 6.2.1 Control level The control level represents the client-side permissions system. A control has defined access methods that can be permitted or not permitted for the different user groups. Each control has at least the default access methods "Observe" and "Operate". "Observe" describes the general observability of the control and thus its visibility to the user. If this access method is not permitted for the user group of the logged-in user, the control is not visible. This also applies to all child controls of the control, if there are any. "Operate" represents the general operability of the control. If this access method is not permitted for the user group of the logged-in user, then the control is displayed as deactivated and no control events that could be initiated by the user (operator events) are initiated. The access methods are configured in the Properties window (Configuring control access [} 970]). The access methods of a user control can be extended via special access methods, so-called virtual permissions (Defining and using virtual permissions of a user control [} 973]). 6.2.1.1 Configuring control access 1. Select the control in the designer. 2. Open the Show Permissions tab in the Properties. 3. Configure the desired permissions of the individual user groups; the following options are available for this: Allow: The access method is permitted for the user group. Disallow: The access method is not permitted for the user group. 970 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 971

User management Inherit: The permission of the user group is derived from the higher-level parent control (container control: View, Content, User Control, Container, Region or User Control Host). Special cases Access methods of a view Operate and Observe are permitted for a view as standard (default = Allow). Since the view –as the entry point to the HMI application –is always the highest container control, the Inherit option is not available. User is a member of several user groups The following rules apply if the user is a member of several user groups: • If Allow is configured for at least one user group, the access method is permitted for the user (Allow). • If Disallow is configured for at least one user group and Allow is not configured for any user group, the access method is not permitted for the user (Disallow). TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 971
## Page 972

User management • If Inherit is configured for all user groups, the permission is derived from the higher-level container control (Inherit). Inherit with other access rights Apart from Operate and Observe, a control can define other access rights [} 1551] (for example, "view Details [} 305]" with Event Grid). Here too, the rights setting of the respective level is checked starting from the respective control. If a control has defined Allow or Disallow here, then the user (as described above) has the configured right. If Inherit is defined here, the higher-level parent control is queried for an explicit setting. It can also be the case that this higher-level parent control does not know the access right. For example, a fictitious right "configure" is discussed here that is not known to the View. It is assumed that a Control Type A exists that knows "configure" and has set default Value Internal [} 1551] to true/Allow. Control Type B also knows "configure", but has set default Value Internal [} 1551] to zero. Sample 1: • Desktop (Tc Hmi View) contains: • Main Container (Tc Hmi Container) contains: • my Control A (Control Type A) "configure" to Allow. Contains: • my Control B (Control Type B) "configure" to Disallow. Disallow acts on my Control B as its own configuration is checked first. Sample 2: • Desktop (Tc Hmi View) contains: • Main Container (Tc Hmi Container) contains: • my Control A (Control Type A) "configure" to Allow. Contains: • my Control B (Control Type B) "configure" to Inherit. Allow acts on my Control B as its own configuration has no definition and the parent control has a direct configuration. Sample 3: • Desktop (Tc Hmi View) contains: • Main Container (Tc Hmi Container) contains: • my Control A (Control Type A) "configure" to Inherit. Contains: • my Control B (Control Type B) "configure" to Inherit. my Control B and the parent control have no configuration of their own and neither Tc Hmi Container nor Tc Hmi View know "configure". Therefore the default Value Internal [} 1551] of the Control Type A is used as it is the last control in the parent-child relationship to which "configure" is known and which defines a value (true/ false or Allow/Disallow). 972 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

User management 6.2.1.2 Defining and using virtual permissions of a user control Defining virtual permissions 1. Open the parameter editor of the user control. 2. Under Virtual Permissions, add the desired additional user control access methods. The following properties can be configured here: Name: Unique name of the virtual permission Description: Description used as a tooltip Additional properties are displayed if you activate the Details checkbox: Internal Name: Internal name used in HTML code (corresponds by default to "Display Name"). Display Name: Name displayed to the user in the engineering (corresponds by default to "Name"). Visible: Visibility of the virtual permission for the user in the engineering. Default Value (Internal): Default return value of the virtual permission if the query of the current permissions situation does not produce a return value. 3. Confirm your input with OK. Using virtual permissions 4. Select a control inside the user control in the designer. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 973
## Page 974

User management 5. Assign a virtual permission for the desired access method to the selected control, which is to represent a special access method of the user control to the outside. The desired access method is now no longer configurable inside the user control. However, it is available for configuration through the assignment of the virtual permissions as an additional access method of the user control host when using the user control in the designer. For the purpose of reusability of the user control, direct configuration of the access methods inside a user control should be dispensed with. The independence of project-specific user groups is achieved with this approach. Accordingly, the default access methods "Observe" and "Operate" should be configured either with "Inherit" or as special access methods via the use of virtual permissions. Special access methods of controls within a user control should always be fed to the outside via the use of virtual permissions because the user control host only has the default access methods "Observe" and "Operate" as standard. 6.2.2 Symbol level The symbol level represents the first part of the server-side permissions system. General and user group- specific access methods, which apply when authentication is active, can be configured for every mapped server symbol (Mapped Symbols). The configuration is done via the Permissions Management editor, which can be called via the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window (Configuring symbol access [} 975]). 974 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 975

User management 6.2.2.1 Configuring symbol access 1. Select the Symbol Permissions tab in the Permission Management editor. 2. Configure the following access methods for a mapped server symbol: Symbol Access: Generally permitted symbol access method that is valid for each user group (default value: Read/Write). Group Symbol Access: Permitted default access method of a user group for all symbols (see also Creating a new user group [} 967]). Specific Group Symbol Access: Permitted user group-specific access method for the symbol that is initially specified by the combination of Symbol Access and Group Symbol Access, whose configurations mutually restrict each other. However, it is also possible to overwrite this combination so that Symbol Access and Group Symbol Access are invalid for this symbol for this user group. 3. Confirm your configuration with OK TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 975
## Page 976

User management Special cases User is a member of several user groups If a user is a member of several user groups, the combination of permitted access methods of the user groups applies, which in this case mutually expand one another. The permitted access methods for system server symbols can be configured in Advanced Mode. 6.2.3 File level The file level represents the second part of the server-side permissions system. General and user group- specific access methods, which apply when authentication is active, can be configured for every file and every folder added to the Twin CAT HMI Server via the publishing. The configuration is done via the Permissions Management editor, which can be called via the Twin CAT HMI Configuration (Configuring file access [} 976]). 6.2.3.1 Configuring file access 1. Select the File and Folder Permissions tab in the Permission Management editor. 2. Configure the following access methods for a file (or a folder): File Access: Generally permitted file access method that is valid for each user group (default value: Read/Write). Group File Access: Permitted default access method of a user group for all files (see also Creating a new user group [} 967]). 976 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 977

User management Specific Group File Access: Permitted user group-specific access method for the file that is initially specified by the combination of File Access and Group File Access, whose configurations mutually restrict each other. However, it is also possible to overwrite this combination so that File Access and Group File Access are invalid for this file for this user group. 3. Confirm your configuration with OK Special cases User is a member of several user groups If a user is a member of several user groups, the combination of permitted access methods of the user groups applies, which in this case mutually expand one another. 6.3 Access management in the client The system provides functions [} 925] for managing access in the client. The functions can be used to log out a user and to check the user's current access. The functions are available in the development environment in the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62]. Check Access Function [} 945] for querying whether a certain control access method is permitted for the logged-in user or not. Go To Login Page Function [} 947] to open the login page without logging out the currently logged in user. This allows a user change to be performed without a previous logout of the user. Logout Function [} 949] for logging out the logged in user from the Twin CAT HMI server. The function loads the login page after the logout. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 977
## Page 978

User management 6.4 Login page If authentication is active, the login page (login dialog) is displayed before the start page is opened and allows users to log in. Start page of the HMI loads only after successful authentication. The login page can be replaced by a user-specific login dialog. This can be added to any Twin CAT HMI project if required. The login page is edited in HTML, CSS and Java Script. It is not possible to edit a login page via the Twin CAT HMI Designer, as the framework is not yet loaded at the time of user login. 978 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 979

User management Available from version 1.10.1336.0 6.4.1 Add login page A Twin CAT HMI project can contain several login pages. Only one login page can be active [} 980] per project. 1. Right-click Add anywhere in the project, and then click New Item. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 979

User management 2. Select the Login Page type and assign a name. ð The login page can now be used in the project. 6.4.2 Switch login page Several login pages can be managed within one project. Only one login page can be active per project. The switching of the active login page takes place in the project properties. To do this, select the project node in the Solution Explorer and open the Properties window [} 54]: 980 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 981

User management The "Default" entry displays the standard login page of the Twin CAT HMI. 6.4.3 Edit login page The creation of a login page takes place within an HTML file with HTML, CSS and Java Script. The template contained in the Twin CAT HMI represents an exemplary login page and can be adapted and modified as required. The comments in the template serve as support. A login page is an HTML page with the following structure: • Head tag: Here you can specify the title of the login page, which is displayed in the browser window. • Style tags: Here the appearance of the login page in CSS is described. • Body tag: The structure of the login page in HTML is described here. • Script tags: Here the logic of the login page is implemented in Java Script. 6.4.3.1 Login The login command enables a user to log in to the Twin CAT HMI server and is sent to the server as a Web Socket request in JSON format. If the authentication data is valid, the server allows the login and calls the start page of the HMI. The Web Socket request must be structured as follows: var message = { "request Type": "Read Write", "commands": [ { "command Options": ["Send Error Message", "Send Write Value"], "symbol": "Login", "write Value": { "user Name": username, "password": password, "persistent": stay Logged In } } ] }; In the template you will find this Web Socket request in the function "Login" in line 350. The base functionality of the requests to the server contained in the template should not be changed in order to ensure proper functioning of the login page. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 981

User management 6.4.3.2 Include graphics Graphics such as a company logo can also be used within a user-specific login page. The use of inline graphics in Base64 format in the HTML file is recommended. The use of graphic resources outside the HMTL file is also possible, but requires additional configuration in the server. inline graphics Within an HTML file, graphics can be integrated as Base64 strings. The Base64 string can be used directly in HTML code or CSS code. With the user-specific login page, this has the advantage that no user rights have to be configured for the "__System Guests [} 969]" group in the server. An HTML image tag with a Base64 string as source is structured as follows: <img src=”data:[mime type];[charset],[base64]”> The "MIME-Type" specifies the original file format, the "Charset" the character encoding and "base64" the data encoding. As an example of an SVG graphic: <img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PD94b Wwg…[rest of base64]"/> The graphics can be encoded into a Base64 string via a Base64 Image Encoder. Encoding can be performed using an online tool, for example. A favicon can also be integrated into the HTML page as an inline graphic. External resources The integration of external graphics into the user-specific login page is possible if they are located within the HMI project. First the graphic must be added to the project. The graphic can then be referenced within the HTML file, for example within an HTML image tag: <img src="manual_pressed.svg" /> Since no user is logged in to the HMI server at the time the login page is loaded, the rights of the "__System Guests" group apply at this point in time. Therefore, this group must be granted explicit access to the graphics to be used within the login page. Open the configuration page of the HMI server in the category "General". 982 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

User management You can also open the Live View user administration simulation in a browser. 1. To do this, click on the corresponding entry in the dropdown list when selecting the browser: 2. A user can be logged out of the Live View via a button in the HMI or the Logout button in the Live View header bar. This button logs out all users from all Live View instances (if additional instances are open in a browser window). 986 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 987

User management 3. After a user logs out, the login page of the server is displayed. There you can then log in any user to test the permission configuration. ð The user administration can now be used in Live View. 6.6 User management in the client In addition to the configuration in the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window, the management (dynamic creation) of users is also possible during runtime in the client. For example, it is possible to add new users to the server at runtime, edit existing users (change password, change group membership) or remove them. It is not possible to manage (dynamically create) groups at runtime. The groups must first be created in engineering and the rights to the corresponding controls configured. If the rights of a user are to be changed, the group membership of the user can be changed. The administration at runtime in the client is made possible by the Framework API. This can be used in the Java Script code. Available since version 1.10.1018.48 6.7 Client certificates The client certificates allow the authentication to be restricted so that only certain clients that have the certificate can access the server and thus the HMI. All other clients that do not have the certificate will not have access to the server. A so-called client certificate, which can be generated and signed by Twin CAT HMI in the engineering department, must be installed in the respective client. The server-side part of the certificate is automatically stored as the remote terminal in the Twin CAT HMI server during generation. A client certificate can optionally be assigned to a user so that the user is automatically logged in via the client certificate. The use of client certificates is optional. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 987

User management Access to the HMI is then granted. If the client certificate has been assigned to [} 989] a user, this user is logged in automatically and the HMI is loaded. Otherwise you have to authenticate yourself with username and password. Communication with the server must be encrypted using HTTPS if you are using a client certificate. Error handling If you have already worked with client certificates before, it may happen that the browser skips the query for a client certificate and access to the HMI is not granted. In this case, you can clear the browser cache and restart the browser. The browser should then query the client certificate and access the HMI. 6.8 Maintenance mode The HMI server license may not be available during maintenance if the USB dongle and License Key Terminal are missing or a client license is not present. The HMI server denies access to the HMI client without a license. Maintenance mode was introduced for this purpose, allowing an HMI client to be run for diagnostic purposes in the event of a license error. A new user group __System Maintenance Users has been introduced. This is displayed in the HMI Configuration window when the advanced server icons are active (1). 998 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Internationalization 7 Internationalization Internationalization in Twin CAT HMI enables the management of languages and units and their switching in the client. Furthermore, the administration of different time zones and time formats is supported. 7.1 Change the language Language switching in Twin CAT HMI is implemented with keys, which are managed in language tables (localization files). Any texts in different languages can be stored in the language table for a key. In the Designer [} 57], the keys are linked directly to the respective control properties [} 61]. The texts behind the respective keys are resolved in the Designer directly in the currently active language. Please note that the language changeover setting is different to the texts for the time display [} 1004] ("time format locale"). Set active language The active language can be set in engineering as follows: • Project properties: The default language for the project can be set in the Project properties [} 54]. • User configuration: The language can be set per user in the User configuration [} 964]. This setting overrides the default language set in the project properties. Manage language tables The language tables (localization files) of a Twin CAT HMI project are managed in the Localization editor [} 108]. Language tables can be added to the project as a new Twin CAT HMI item [} 961]. Switch language in client The active language can be switched at runtime in the client, regardless of which language settings have been specified in the project properties and for the logged in user. Switching during runtime is easy to implement with the control Localization Select [} 459]. In the Actions & Conditions Editor [} 62], the switch can be made using the "Set Locale [} 939]" function. It can also be changed by programming via the API Tc Hmi. Locale.load. 7.2 Unit conversion Unit switching in Twin CAT HMI enables the switching of the displayed units and the conversion of the corresponding values depending on the language or a specific event. Conversion of values The conversion of the units is solved by functions [} 925]. A function is linked to the Control property in [} 112] the properties window and returns the converted value. As a parameter value, the function receives the output value that is present in a certain unit. Within the function, the developer can convert [} 1476] the corresponding value (e.g. from a symbol in the PLC) into the desired unit. The respective unit can be added to the converted value directly within the function as a string or alternatively stored as a language key. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1003
## Page 1004

Internationalization Switching units The units can be switched depending on the language or any other event. To do this, another parameter is passed to the function that contains the unit into which the value is to be converted. As soon as this parameter changes, the function is automatically called again and the value is converted and returned accordingly. For example, pass an internal symbol [} 88] to the function that contains the unit into which the value is to be converted. The unit can be written anywhere in the internal symbol. Possible scenarios are e.g: • "on Locale Changed [} 103]": This global event is triggered as soon as a language is loaded. At this event the unit can be written into the internal symbol according to the active language [} 938]. • Events: Depending on any event, [} 40] a unit can be written into the internal symbol. The event can be triggered, for example, if a value in the PLC changes or the user has pressed a button on the user interface. 7.3 Localization Localization in Twin CAT HMI enables the management of different time zones and time formats. The server is based on the UTC time. Some controls (for example, the Event Grid and the Trend Line Chart) require a timestamp. To display the times on the client according to their region (with time offset), the time zone and time format can be specified in the project properties or per user. Please note that the setting for the time display ("time format locale") is different to the texts for language switching [} 1003]. Setting in the project properties The setting of the time zone and time format can be set for the project in the project properties [} 54]. Setting in the user properties The time zone and time format settings can be set per user [} 964]. This setting overrides the setting in the project properties when user authentication is active. Available from version 1.10.1336.0 7.4 Keyboard layouts The Twin CAT HMI offers different keyboard layouts for different countries and regions. Each layout is available with or without numpad and with or without indirect input field. The compact versions of the German and American keyboards are integrated as standard.

Themes 8 Themes The theme system allows you to switch the design of all elements. The theme can be switched during runtime per client or globally in the project properties. Only one theme can be active at a time (similar to language switching [} 1003]). A theme can change the appearance of a control (e.g. Top [} 762], Left [} 761], Width [} 762], Height [} 763], Background Color [} 770] etc.). Besides the appearance of the control, all control attributes [} 114] can be changed. A theme can be created via the integrated theme editor or directly as a CSS file. Available since version 1.10 8.1 Introduction In a Twin CAT HMI project, the various themes are located under the "Themes" project node: The theme node contains all themes defined for the project. For each theme there is a ".theme" file, which contains the JSON definition of a theme and can be opened with the theme editor. The default theme can be viewed and switched under the general project properties (click on the project node and open the Properties window). For a new project, the base theme is included in the project and set as the default theme. The base theme includes the font setting, which is included at project level regardless of the theme (see Fonts). In addition, each Twin CAT HMI Control has a base theme, which describes the design of the control if this is not explicitly overwritten by the developer in Engineering or by another theme. 1010 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Open the Properties window for a control and select the entry Class Names under Common: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1015
## Page 1016

Themes 5. In the dialog, select the control classes that you want to add to the control. To do this, select the required control class and press the arrow. Confirm the dialog with OK: ð The control class is now assigned to the control, and the properties of the control class are used. If you add several classes to a control and each class describes the same attributes, the properties of the last class in the list apply (analogous to the class selectors in CSS). To display the attribute properties of the class theme, the attribute must not be explicitly set at the control. The control colors must be set to Theme. 8.2.2 Control theme A control theme defines the properties for all instances of a control. The control theme is defined for each theme in the theme editor [} 1012] at project level. 1016 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1017

Themes The following steps are required to create a Control theme: 1. First, the control type must be selected in the theme editor. In the upper screenshot the control type Button was selected. 2. After selecting the control type, select the attribute from the respective changeable attributes. 3. Drag and drop the attribute onto the large area for the attribute properties in the center of the editor. 4. You can define any number of additional attributes for the control type. Control types that contains defined attribute properties are shown in bold font. To change the attribute properties for a control type at a later stage, select the respective control type again. The existing configurations are then automatically displayed in the center of the theme editor. A property that has already been configured can be deleted by selecting it and then pressing the Delete key. To display the attribute properties of the Control theme, the attribute must not be explicitly set at the control. The control colors must be set to Theme. 8.2.3 CSS theme Beside the control theme and the class theme there is the possibility to add [} 1010] any number of Cascading Style Sheets files to a theme. A distinction is made between a normal CSS file and a CSS control theme file. CSS files can also be added at project level, independent of a theme. These files define general properties such as the inclusion of fonts. Cascading Style Sheets file A Cascading Style Sheets file allows the definition of any CSS properties for all elements contained in the project (standard controls, framework controls etc.). In addition, specific CSS classes can be overwritten by a control. All CSS selectors and CSS properties are available within a CSS file. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1017
## Page 1018

Themes If a class theme [} 1013] is defined in the theme editor, it can be addressed in the CSS code via the class name with the prefix tchmi-class-. Example: tchmi-class-myclassthemeclass CSS control theme file A CSS control theme file can be used to replace specific CSS properties of the base theme. This is made possible by importing all CSS properties of the control into the CSS control theme file of the project. In the next window you have to select the control for which you want to create a CSS control theme file. In this dialog you can select several controls for which a CSS control theme is to be generated. You must also select from which theme the CSS control theme should be derived. If you select the Base theme, all properties defined in the Base theme of the control are displayed. Some controls contain further Twin CAT HMI Controls, e.g. the Event Grid. This is indicated in the dialog by a note (upside down exclamation mark) after the control. If you want to overwrite all properties, you must also include the CSS files of the child controls. For more detailed information about the dependencies between the individual controls, see the documentation for each control. The following example shows a CSS control theme file for the control Tc Hmi Button [} 176]: /** Styles for the theme: Base */ /* Style for the main element */ .tchmi-button { /* color gradient for default view */ background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, #eff1f3, #aeb9c2); /* default color for button text */ 1018 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1019

Themes color: #4794da; /* default box shadow */ box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); } /* class down will be set/unset in the control on mouse/touch down */ .tchmi-button.down { /* another color gradient */ background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, #aeb9c2, #eff1f3); color: #000000; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); } 8.3 Theme switching You can switch the entire theme in the project properties, the theme editor or during runtime using a function. Controls allow you to switch between different theme classes within a theme at runtime. Individual control attributes can be assigned a theme property at runtime if they have been overwritten previously. Switching in the properties The default theme can be viewed and switched under the general project properties (click on the project node and open the Properties window). The theme editor [} 1012] features the Default Theme property in the header bar at the top, irrespective of the theme. There you can set the default theme in the same way as in the project properties. Switching at runtime The theme can be switched during runtime in the browser for each client [} 18]. To do this, an action must be configured, e.g. on the .on Pressed event of a button (so that the theme is switched when a specific button is pressed). In the Actions and Conditions editor, the Theme folder contains the Set Theme function under functions. Use drag & drop to add this function under the actions and enter the name of the theme by selecting it in the combo box. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1019
## Page 1020

Themes Switching classes In certain cases it is necessary to switch not the entire theme, but only the properties of a group of elements or a particular control instance during runtime. This is possible if different theme classes [} 1013] are defined for the control. During runtime the attribute Class Names [} 760] of the control is then set again. To do this, an action must be configured at runtime, as for theme switching. Switching from control attributes to a theme A control attribute, which is set by an attribute definition directly at the control (Level 1 [} 1021]), can be set to the value of the currently active theme during runtime with the Set Attribute To Theme Value [} 944] function. The value of the attribute is then changed according to the active theme each time the theme is switched. 1020 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1021

Themes This function is used if individual control attributes are to be overwritten and then reset to the value of a theme. 8.4 Concept Theming in Twin CAT HMI distinguishes between control-based themes and class-based themes. A control theme [} 1016] specifies properties that apply to all instances of the respective control type. A class theme [} 1013] specifies properties that only apply to controls to which this class is assigned. You can assign several classes to a control. The theme properties can be set at different levels. Cascading Style Sheets use a comparable approach in the sphere of web development, for example. The levels determine which property applies to an element if different properties are defined for an element. The properties of the higher levels are overwritten by the properties of the lower levels, if these are defined. The lowest level is level 1, which overwrites all properties of the higher levels. The theme system has the following levels: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1021
## Page 1022

Themes Level 1: Attribute level [} 1023] This level describes the appearance using attribute definitions at the control. In analogy to the CSS world, this level would be a "style" attribute that is defined directly at the element. Levels 2-4: attribute levels [} 1023] Like level 1, these levels describe the appearance using attribute definitions at the control. In analogy to the CSS world, these levels would be external CSS files. Level 5: attribute levels [} 1023] Like levels 1-4, this level describes the appearance using attribute definitions at the control. If nothing is specified above levels 1-4, this default Value Internal value applies. In the analogy to the CSS world these levels would be comparable to the font color black, for example, which applies even if nothing else has been defined. Levels 6-9: element levels [} 1023] These levels describe the appearance of a control using Cascading Style Sheets files if the appearance of a control cannot be defined using an attribute or has not been defined using an attribute. 1022 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1023

Themes 8.4.1 Attribute levels The attribute levels describe the appearance of the controls using attribute definitions. Level 1: Attribute definition at the control at project level The attribute definition on a control instance overwrites all properties defined by a theme. The attribute definition at the control [} 114] is specified in the Properties window or directly in the HTML code. The attribute definition at the control follows the usual procedure for overwriting the default properties of the base theme if no other theme is defined. This option has been available since version 1.8. Level 2: Attribute definition in a class at project level The attribute definition in a class [} 1013] is specified in the theme editor of the respective theme at project level. The class is added to a control as a property so that it automatically adopts the attribute definitions of the class. The attribute definition in a class overwrites the attribute definition for a control type if both definitions contain the same attribute. Level 3: Attribute definition per control type at project level The attribute definitions in a control type [} 1016] are specified in the theme editor of the respective theme at project level. The attribute definition in a control type applies to all instances of the respective control in the project and is only overwritten by level 1 or level 2. Level 4: Attribute definition per control type at control level The attribute definition per control type at control level [} 1504] is specified directly in the directory of the control and is defined by the control developer. The definition is the same as in level 2 within a .theme file. For the standard controls, this property cannot be changed at the control level. The attribute definition per control type at control level is therefore only available for framework control developers. Level 5: Attribute definition through Default Value Internal at control level The Default Value Internal [} 1497] defines the properties of an attribute independent of the active theme and is used if the attribute is not overwritten by a theme at the higher levels. In addition to the attribute definitions, it is possible to configure so-called Themed Resources at levels 2 to 4. The Themed Resources are control properties that cannot be configured via the Properties window and can only be changed via the theme system. An example of this are the knob definitions [} 457] at the Linear Gauge. The definition [} 1498] of Themed Resources is handled by the control developer. 8.4.2 Element levels The element levels describe the appearance of the controls using Cascading Style Sheets files. Level 6: Cascading Style Sheets per theme at project level At project level it is possible to add, in addition to the .theme file of the theme editor, any number of CSS files to a theme in the project (see Introduction [} 1010]). If a control is described in the theme editor and also in a CSS file within the theme, the definitions within the theme editor (lower level) apply. Level 7: Cascading Style Sheets at project level At the project level, any number of Cascading Style Sheets files can be defined, independent of a theme. This option has been available since version 1.8 under the name CSS-Behind file. The definitions within the CSS file at the project level overwrite the CSS definitions at the control level and apply regardless of the theme. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1023
## Page 1024

Themes Any CSS-Behind files at project level, which were already added to the project with version 1.8, can still be used. When using different themes, it usually makes sense to assign this file to a specific theme. Level 8: Cascading Style Sheets per theme at control level Any number of Cascading Style Sheets files can be added to a theme at the control level. The CSS definitions at control level describe the normal layout of all elements of a control. These properties apply if no properties of the control are overwritten by a theme at the higher levels. Each control should implement at least one theme called Base. Level 9: Cascading Style Sheets at control level At the control level, you can add any number of general Cascading Style Sheets files that describe the properties of elements, regardless of the theme. 1024 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Package management 9 Package management The package management in Twin CAT HMI makes it possible to export Twin CAT HMI components such as a Framework Control [} 1481] or a Server Extension [} 1457] into a package. These packages can easily be installed in further Twin CAT HMI projects. This allows libraries to be created for HMI components to facilitate exchange within a company. Many extensions in Twin CAT HMI are themselves delivered as a package and can optionally be installed in a Twin CAT HMI project. 9.1 Versions 1.8 and 1.10 The Twin CAT HMI package management available in versions 1.8 and 1.10 makes it possible to export a Twin CAT HMI extensibility project as a Twin CAT HMI package (.tchmipkg). A Twin CAT HMI Package can be installed as a reference in a Twin CAT HMI project. Twin CAT HMI packages are supported up to and including version 1.10. The package management in version 1.12 is based on Nu Get as package management system [} 1034]. Legacy support for the Twin CAT HMI packages is also available in version 1.12.

Controls 11.5 Event Grid The Event Grid control is a control for the tabular display of alarms and messages. The filter of the control is predefined for the Alarm [} 1141] and Event Logger [} 1154] extension. Accordingly, the messages/alarms from both extensions, if available, are displayed in the control. Alarms can be confirmed directly in the control. 1082 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1083

Controls API of the Event Grid [} 286] control. Available since version 1.10. 11.5.1 Configuration The Event Grid control is located in the Toolbox under the category Beckhoff, from where you can insert it into an HMI page by drag and drop. Apart from the tabular display of the alarms and messages, the control offers various configuration options in the engineering and during the runtime in the browser. Detailed view A detailed view can be called for each message and alarm in the Event Grid. The detailed view is opened by selecting a row in the Event Grid and double-clicking on the row. The detailed view provides additional information about the event. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1083
## Page 1084

Controls Filter Filters enable the display of alarms and messages according to certain criteria. It is possible, for example, to display only active alarms or to filter according to a certain time period. The filters can be configured under Filter [} 293] in the control's properties. You can switch between different filters at runtime by calling a Write To Symbol [} 66] for the filter of the Event Grid. Alternatively, you can use various filter settings via the control's menu bar [} 305]. Columns The configuration of the columns defines which columns are displayed in the Event Grid control. By default the type (alarm or message), the severity, the timestamp of the input and the associated text are displayed. Further columns such as the time of the confirmation can be configured in the control's properties [} 294]. The settings apply to all clients. There is an option at runtime to change the columns displayed per client. To do this, open the column editor from the menu bar [} 305]. The column editor automatically opens a popup with an overlay and positions itself in the center of the view: 1084 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1085

Controls Confirming an alarm An alarm can be confirmed by selecting the row containing the alarm and clicking on the button Confirm alarm (single check mark) in the menu bar [} 305]. If several alarms are active, there is an option to confirm all alarms simultaneously. To do this, click on the button Confirm All Alarms (two check marks) in the menu bar [} 305]. A popup with an overlay then opens automatically and displays all active alarms. At this point, you have the option of canceling the dialog or confirming all active alarms. Restricting rights Within the context of an authorization system it may be useful to allow only certain operators to access the Event Grid. In addition, individual operators may be assigned rights to confirm the events. Rights are configured in Twin CAT HMI at two levels (see User Management [} 964]). TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1085
## Page 1086

Controls At control level the configuration right (configuration at runtime) and the right to a detail view can be granted [} 304] explicitly in addition to the standard rights for the Event Grid. The right to confirm the alarms can be granted at symbol level. To do this, open the Permissions Management [} 974] in the expert view. Further configuration options Further configuration options for the Event Grid control can be found under Event Grid [} 286]. Example An example of the use of the Event Logger with the Event Grid: Example [} 1585] The example shows two different configuration options for the Event Grid and the associated PLC project, in which example alarms and messages can be generated. 11.6 Event Line The Event Line control is a control for displaying alarms or messages. The filter of the control is predefined for the Alarm [} 1141] and Event Logger [} 1154] extension. Accordingly, the messages/alarms from both extensions, if available, are displayed in the control. API of the Event Line [} 306] control. Available since version 1.12.748.0. 11.6.1 Configuration There are several parameters for configuring the Event Line control: Message Format: The message format is set in the Message Format. Individual text blocks can be added, removed or changed in the display sequence. Target Region: In order to ensure fast page switching on a click, the region in which the content from "Target Content" is to be displayed can be set directly here. 1086 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1087

Controls Target Content: To ensure fast page switching on a click, the content to be opened can be set directly here, which should be displayed in the region from "Target Region". Filter: A filter can be defined for the control in order to filter for specific messages. This will then only display the desired messages. Sorting: Sorting is used to define which message is to be displayed in the Event Line. A sort sequence is defined. Only the message at the top of the list is displayed. Server Interval: With the server interval, it is possible to change the query interval in order to receive messages faster or slower. A faster interval results in greater utilization and is therefore not recommended for small controllers. Show Message If Empty: Enable "Show Message If Empty" to receive textual feedback if no message is found. Without this option, the text field in the control remains empty. 11.7 Indicator Light The Indicator Light control is used for the simple display of a Boolean value. The control is included in the Nu Get package Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Industries. Common >= 14.3. The package can be installed via Tc Pkg (Twin CAT. HMI. Industries. Common) or nuget.org. 11.7.1 Configuration Configuration of the Indicator Light control. Integration: Several settings can be made on the Indicator Light control. State Symbol: Specifies the symbol that generates a state change. Only symbols are permitted and no direct values. This is a reading symbol. 11.8 Motion Control Motion Control is used for simple control of axes. This makes the control suitable for simple movement or optimization of axes. The built-in functions can be used to position the axis or perform a reversing sequence (NC mode). The control also offers an error display so that messages from the axis can be displayed directly. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1087
## Page 1088

Controls The control is included in the Nu Get package Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Motion >= 14.1.15. The package can be installed via Tc Pkg (Twin CAT. HMI. Motion) or nuget.org. CAUTION No safe axis stop This control has no safety function to stop an axis safely. This is the responsibility of the user. Therefore, the control points this out again. 1088 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1089

Controls 11.8.1 Configuration Configuration of the Motion Control. Integration: The integration can be made via two interfaces, whereby the PLC interface overwrites the NC interface if both are configured at the same time. In order to use the control, an interface must be used. NC: Establishes a connection via ADS directly to the NC. You can switch between the individual axes within the NC task via dropdown. In addition, the direct NC integration has several functionalities such as a "Reversing Sequence" in addition to the normal control. The attributes are located under the "Common" category in the properties window of the control: • Main NC: Connects the control directly to the Main NC. To do this, a new connection must be established in the ADS extension to the Main NC (default port: 500) with the name entered here. • NC task: Connects the control directly to an NC task. To do this, a new connection must be established in the ADS extension to the NC task (default first task port: 501) with the name entered here. PLC: Establishes a connection to the NC via PLC function blocks. Only one axis can be selected directly here. This type of integration only has an absolute function in addition to the normal control. The attributes are located under the "PLC" category in the properties window of the control: • AXIS_REF: Reference to the axis to be controlled. This is required to read information about the axis. • MC_Halt: Function block for stopping the axis. • MC_Home: Function block for referencing an axis. • MC_Move Absolute: Function block for executing an absolute movement of the axis. • MC_Move Velocity: Function block to execute a continuous movement of the axis. • MC_Power: Function block to enable the axis. • MC_Reset: Function block for resetting axis errors. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1089
## Page 1090

Controls NOTICE Loss of function When using the PLC interface, all function blocks must always be linked. Otherwise, some functionalities cannot be used or the control has no function. NOTICE Linked function blocks of the PLC always have priority for the integration of the HMI If, for example, a value such as an enable is written from the PLC via an MC_Power function block, it cannot be overwritten by the HMI. The control: The control is divided into three different tabs. The dropdown for selecting the axes is only available in NC mode. Online: All important information about the axis can be seen in the Online tab. Enablings or movements () can be executed. In addition, detailed information on the movement of the axis such as status, set/actual position or lag distance is listed. This makes it easy to set an axis in motion. Functions: Various axis functions can be executed in the Functions tab. Only "Absolute" is available for an axis in PLC mode. For an axis that is connected via the NC, the same functions are available as in the System Manager. This allows functions such as "Reversing Sequence" to be used to move an axis back and forth between two positions. This could be interesting for optimizing the axis or for test movements. Depending on the function selected, the associated parameters under the dropdown will change. 1090 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1091

Controls Error Log: The axis errors are displayed in the Error Log tab. The display of axis errors enables quick countermeasures to be taken. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1091

Controls 11.9.1 Configuration Show all In the Show all area, all symbols available in the control are displayed in a large list. This makes it easier to search for symbols whose exact nesting is unclear. No changes The No changes tab changes its text as soon as symbols for writing a new value are available. It shows a list of all symbols that have been prepared for writing to the PLC Import symbols Import symbols can be used to re-insert the machine parameters from an export file. Export symbols Export symbols exports all current values of the symbols persisted in the extension to a JSON file. This can be used to insert default parameters in standard machines or to save the current machine status. Config runtime Config runtime shows which runtime is accessed in the System Engineering extension. Update PLC symbols Clicking on Update PLC symbols triggers a reload of the configuration. This is necessary if no automatic update has been enabled in the background. If the structure in the PLC is changed, this does not automatically lead to an adjustment of the data in the control. During the update, an overlay opens to display the current status of the update. Navigation The navigation, which is automatically generated by attributes in the PLC, is located in the lower area. You will see a lock next to the name if the appropriate authorization has been granted. You can use the lock to configure the authorization of the user groups for the individual symbols. PROGRAM MAIN VAR {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Name' := 'Machine'} {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Tree View Image' := 'Portal/normal.svg'} fb Machine : FB_Machine Unit; END_VAR The lock on the right-hand side of the navigation is used to set the read and write authorization. Clicking opens a pop-up for the corresponding level with its symbols. This setting can be enabled or disabled for the relevant users via the user management. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1095
## Page 1096

Controls 11.9.2 Machine parameters The machine parameters are required to define the machine. Parameters that need to be adjusted for each machine can be entered here. These parameters are persisted in the background by the System Engineering Extension. When the Twin CAT 3 HMI server is started, the parameters are written to the PLC. This allows for quick and easy commissioning or maintenance of the individual areas of the machine. Search There is a search bar at the top of the control that can be used to search for machine parameters. The locations found are highlighted in yellow. Entries that do not match the search are hidden. Symbolname The name defined in the PLC using attributes ('Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Name') is used as the Symbolname. In addition, the symbol path within the PLC and an info text ('Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Info') are displayed. The symbol path can be hidden via an attribute on the control. Value The current values of the variables within the PLC are displayed in the Value column. Prepared Value The corresponding variables can be prepared for a change in Prepared Value. By clicking the Edit button, the required control is loaded and pre-initialized with the current value. The pre-initialization function can be disabled on the control via an attribute. If it is a value with Min ('Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Min) and/or Max ('Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Max) values, these are validated during input. The limits are also displayed on the input control. Apply The Apply button can be used to write the values defined in Prepared Value to the PLC. This can be done individually using the corresponding button in the same line or collectively using the Apply all button. History History is only available in connection with the Audit Trail [} 1180] Extension. All changes to the value from the HMI to the PLC are logged here. You can use the History button to view the change history for the corresponding variable. 11.10 Push Button The Push Button control is used for simple control of a Boolean value.

To do this, you can map directly via the server or the configuration window [} 78] within Visual Studio. 12.1.1.2 Configuration General The basic settings for the Server extension are specified in the General tab. 1116 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1117

Extensions Runtimes [} 1118] • Establish a connection to a device via ADS. Timeout • Specifies how long an attempt is made to establish a connection or a read request is performed before a timeout occurs. Support incomplete writing operations by reading before writing • Was required for older Twin CAT versions < 4024.17. With newer Twin CAT versions, disabling can lead to better performance. Maximum timeout for runtime status determination (Advanced settings) • A configured runtime is considered unavailable if a request takes longer than this period of time. Interval of runtime status determination (advanced settings) • The status of each configured runtime is checked at regular intervals. Ignored PLC attributes (advanced settings) • Attribute pragmas are added to the JSON schema. The attributes configured here are hidden. Visible runtime ports (advanced settings) • Target systems can have many ADS ports. Most of them are rarely used in HMI projects. Limiting the response size of ADS requests (Advanced settings) • The PLC task is blocked for each request. If the request is too large, the PLC cycle time may be exceeded. Limitation of the number of ADS requests that can be bundled in a sum request (Advanced settings) • The PLC task is blocked for each request. If a sum request contains too many requests, the PLC cycle time may be exceeded. Limiting the number of ADS handles created with a sum request (Advanced settings) • The Twin CAT handle buffer is not increased during a sum request. Creating too many ADS handles in a single sum request leads to errors if the Twin CAT handle buffer is full. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1117

Extensions 12.1.1.2.1 Runtimes Establish a connection via ADS to another process. Enabled • Enable or disable the connection to the set AMS Net Id. Ams Net Id • AMS Net Id to which a connection is to be established. Port • Specifies the port for the ADS connection. Use whitelisting • Indicates whether whitelisting is used. Variables in the PLC are only found if the corresponding attributes [} 1120] have been set on the PLC variable. Allow only read access • Indicates whether only reading via ADS is possible. 1118 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1119

Extensions Symbols [} 1119] • Provides variables without symbol names. These are addressed via the Index group and the Index offset. 12.1.1.2.1.1 Access by Index Group and Offset It makes most sense to access PLC variables by symbol name in order to detect changes in the symbolism (e.g. due to an Online Change). Small controllers (e.g. BC/BX) that have no symbolism can be addressed directly via Index group and offset. Via the configured ADS runtime you can add a new symbol that fetches the values by Index group and offset (hex values are converted to the corresponding decimal values). Name • Name of the new symbol. Index group • Index group of the data which should be read. Index offset • Index offset of the data which should be read. Data type • Data type of the new symbol. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1119
## Page 1120

Extensions 12.1.1.2.2 Blacklisting and whitelisting With version 1.12, it is possible to use black or whitelisting for PLC symbols. With black or whitelisting, PLC symbols can be explicitly hidden or shown for use in the HMI. For this, you can tag the corresponding variables in the PLC with an attribute pragma. In the default case, blacklisting is active, which means that you have access to all variables of the PLC that are not explicitly hidden for the HMI. On the configuration page of the ADS extension, you can switch between black and whitelisting (Use whitelisting). The following attribute pragmas are available for black or whitelisting in the Twin CAT HMI: { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Show' } { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Show Recursively' } { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Hide' } { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Read Only' } { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. BLOB' } Use: • Tc Hmi Symbol. Show: If a variable has this attribute, it will be displayed in the HMI in case of whitelisting. With this attribute only the first level is displayed (example: only the struct, but not the sub- elements). The attribute has no effect on blacklisting. 1120 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1121

Extensions • Tc Hmi Symbol. Show Recursively: If a variable has this attribute, it is displayed with all sub-elements in the HMI in the case of whitelisting (e.g. structure or function block with all sub-elements). Variables in the sub-elements that are blacklisted with Tc Hmi Symbol. Hide are not displayed. • Tc Hmi Symbol. Hide: If a variable has this attribute, it will not be displayed in the HMI in case of blacklisting. All variables without an attribute are displayed. If the attribute is used with a structure, all sub-elements are also hidden in the HMI, even if they are tagged with Tc Hmi Symbol. Show. • Tc Hmi Symbol. Read Only: If a variable has this attribute, the variable with all sub-elements cannot be written in the HMI. • Tc Hmi Symbol. BLOB: If a variable has this attribute, the data is transferred to the server and the client in binary form (reduction of packet size). The data must be converted in the client itself. Blacklisting overrides whitelisting. With blacklisting, all variables are visible in the HMI, except variables with the attribute Tc Hmi- Symbol. Hide. With whitelisting, no variables are visible in the HMI except variables with the attributes Tc Hmi Symbol. Show and Tc Hmi Symbol. Show Recursively. Available since version 1.12. 12.1.1.2.3 Methods and properties With version 1.12 it is possible to access PLC properties in the HMI and to call PLC methods in the HMI. PLC properties The properties must be made visible in the PLC with an attribute pragma via ADS. {attribute 'monitoring' := 'call'} PROPERTY Prop : BOOL You can then access the property in the Twin CAT HMI. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1121
## Page 1122

Extensions PLC properties can only be used explicitly in the HMI by linking the property individually to a control attribute. If the entire function block is linked to a control attribute, the property is not called. This is the case when a function block is used as the source data of the Data Grid or as a user control parameter. PLC methods The methods must be switched visible in the PLC with an attribute pragma via ADS. {attribute 'Tc Rpc Enable'} METHOD My Method : BOOL VAR_INPUT b Input : BOOL; END_VAR Afterwards you can see the methods in the Twin CAT HMI. Within the Twin CAT HMI Configuration Window, you can call them explicitly. At runtime in the client, you can call the methods using a Java Script/Type Script function and the Framework API. Below you will find an example for the call via Framework API. // call of method without parameter Tc Hmi. Symbol.read Ex2("%s%PLC1. MAIN.fb Test. Method Without Param%/s%", function (data) { console.log(data); }); // call of method with parameter Tc Hmi. Symbol.write Ex("%s%PLC1. MAIN.fb Test. My Method%/s%", { b Input: true }, function (data) { console.log(data); }); If the method has a return value, you can access the return value within the callback function in the Result object. 1122 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1123

Extensions In a future version of the Twin CAT HMI, it will be possible to call the methods directly via the Actions and Conditions Editor without using Java Script/Type Script. Methods must always be called explicitly and cannot be used as a control attribute. Note that calling a method from the HMI results in the execution of PLC code. Available from version 1.12. 12.1.1.2.4 Pointers and references With version 1.12.748.0, references, pointers and interface pointers can be resolved in the HMI. This makes it possible to access the original variable being pointed to via the pointer or reference. This can be read and written when accessing via the pointer or reference. The resolved pointers or references are listed as usual under the variables in the Twin CAT HMI Configuration Window. Changing the addresses of the pointers or references so that they point to another variable is not possible in the HMI. This must be done in the PLC. Available from version 1.12.748.0. 12.1.1.3 ADS Server Interface The HMI Server's ADS Server When the HMI server is started as a service, the service manager opens an ADS server on port 19800. This ADS server can be used to discover and get the state of HMI server instances that are managed by the service manager. Index groups and index offsets Read-Write requests The "RW" value in the "Access" column indicates that only Read-Write requests are supported for this index group index offset combination. All index offsets of the INDEXGROUP_SERVERSTATES index group expect the name of the managed server instance as a write-value. It is analogous to a function parameter. The following table contains all supported index groups: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1123

The HMIVERSION type Normally, ADS uses three-part version numbers consisting of a major version, a revision number and a build number. The Twin CAT HMI uses four-part version numbers instead. To solve this problem, the HMIVERSION type was introduced. It is returned by requests to the following index group index offset combinations: • INDEXGROUP_SERVERSTATES:INDEXOFFSET_SERVERSTATE_PRODUCT_VERSION • INDEXGROUP_SERVERSTATES:INDEXOFFSET_SERVERSTATE_VERSION • INDEXGROUP_SERVERSTATES:INDEXOFFSET_SERVERSTATE_PRODUCT_VERSION • INDEXGROUP_SERVERSTATES:INDEXOFFSET_SERVERSTATE_PROJECT_VERSION Type definition in Structured Text (ST): TYPE HMIVERSION :STRUCT one : UDINT; two : UDINT; three : UDINT; four : UDINT; END_STRUCTEND_TYPE Type definition in C: struct HMIVERSION { uint32_t one; 1126 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Recipe Management [} 1160] Recipe Management is used for easy handling of recipes. Recipe Management can be used to create and change recipes based on a recipe type. The recipe is loaded via the HMI. When loading, the values from the recipe are written to the corresponding symbols (variables) in the PLC. 12.3.1 Recipe Management The Recipe Management enables the activation of symbol values that are managed in recipes. Furthermore, online values from the development environment and from the visualization clients can be saved by the target system in a recipe. Prerequisite for the use of the recipe management is the installation of the Recipe Management extension. Recipe types and recipes A fundamental distinction is made between recipe types and recipes. Comparable with a class in the object orientation, a recipe type is a general description of a set of symbols. On the basis of this description you can create various recipes, comparable with an instance of a class. Specific values for the symbols defined in the recipe type can be saved in a recipe. 1160 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1161

Extensions The definition of colors as color codes is used as an example. In this example the recipe type Color describes the general structure of a color with its red, green and blue components. Three color recipes for yellow, light gray and navy are created on the basis of this description. The color components defined for these colors are each saved in the three different recipes. Inheritance of symbol configurations If, by default, certain recipe types are to have a base set of symbols managed in a central place, then these recipe types can inherit [} 1166]from one or more recipe types. As a result they contain the symbol entries configured in these parent recipe types. These entries are automatically updated in case of changes being made in the parent recipe types. Reuse of recipes in other recipes In order to reuse already defined recipes [} 1167] in other recipes, a recipe type may possess one or more recipe types as members, comparable with standard symbol entries. To do this you can drag and drop the recipe type of the recipe to be reused from the TC HMI Configuration window into the symbol list [} 1171] in the basic recipe type and then enter the recipe to be reused into the recipes derived from it.

Extensions 12.3.1.2.2.1 Example The Recipe Management Sample shows the use of the Recipe Management [} 1160] at runtime. It thereby extends the functions available in the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62] by the use of the Framework API. The sample serves as the point of entry to the recipe management and can be extended as desired. In parallel with the sample project, observe the chapter "Management in the engineering [} 1162]". The sample consists of a Twin CAT HMI project and a Twin CAT project with example symbols in the PLC. The sample contains a total of three symbols, which are used by two different recipe types. Symbol 1 and Symbol 2 are the symbols from the PLC and Symbol 3 is an offline symbol [} 82]. The offline symbol illustrates that symbols from other sources (OPC UA, user-specific server extension, etc.) can also be used as the ADS extension. The sample can be downloaded here [} 1586]. User interface The sample has a user interface in the client that can execute various functions of the recipe management at runtime. These are described in more detail below. 1174 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1175

Extensions 1. Recipe selection: All available recipe types are displayed in the combo box. If there is a recipe inside a folder, the relative path to the recipe is displayed. The combo box is used to select the recipe that is used as the basis for the other buttons and fields in this sample. 2. Teach and activate recipe:: The recipe currently selected in the combo box can be edited in this area. • Teach selected recipe: The currently selected recipe is taught again. This means that the current online values are adopted from the PLC and saved in the recipe. • Teach as new recipe: A new recipe is created with the current online values from the PLC based on the currently selected recipe. A new name for the recipe must be entered in the text box. • Activate selected recipe: The currently selected recipe is activated. This means that the values stored in the recipe are written to the corresponding symbols in the PLC. • Delete selected recipe: The currently selected recipe is deleted. 3. Upload and download recipe: This area enables recipes to be downloaded and uploaded. The file browser of the respective browser that enables the selection of the storage location or the selection of the recipe thereby opens. The upload and download functions are not available in the Live View in Visual Studio. 4. Display and edit recipe: This area enables the display and editing of the recipe members (symbols) of the currently selected recipe. • Datagrid: The currently selected recipe is loaded and the individual members are displayed in the datagrid. The "New value" column has two different functions. Firstly, the column is used to receive new values for the individual members of the recipe, which are subsequently saved by clicking on the Update selected recipe button. Secondly, the column is used to display the current online values of the members for comparison with the stored values by clicking on the Read values from target button. • Update selected recipe: This button saves the recipe with the new values specified in the "New value" column. • Read values from target: This button reads the current online values of the recipe members and displays them in the "New value" column.

The directory service (e.g. Active Directory from Microsoft) is often used in larger companies to centrally manage users and groups. Application scenario The Twin CAT HMI LDAP Extension enables access to an LDAP server so that the user groups in the Twin CAT HMI server are available for user management. Advantages • Central user management: The Twin CAT HMI server uses the Twin CAT HMI user management extension by default, from which only a local HMI server can access. The Twin CAT HMI LDAP extension can be used by several HMI servers locally or in the network (LAN and WAN). • User management without HMI admin rights: Users and groups can be managed centrally by the company’s IT department. If a new employee joins or leaves the company, the rights can be adjusted without HMI engineering. It is not necessary to restart the server. • Access to all directory information: In addition to the user groups, all directory information can be queried. • No additional license required: The Twin CAT HMI LDAP extension is included in the TF2000 HMI server license. Architecture The LDAP Server Extension runs in the . NET Extension Container (1) in an independent process and connects to the server (2) via LDAP. The HMI Server and LDAP Extension communicate as usual via Websocket (3). 1232 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1233

Extensions Within the HMI project, authorizations cannot be configured directly with the LDAP groups. HMI groups are created and configured in the usual way. In the LDAP Extension, the HMI and LDAP groups can be connected via group mappings (1, 2). The HMI Server creates the LDAP users as HMI users at the first login (3). 12.7.1 System requirements Version 1.14 Technical data Operating system Windows 10 (32/64-bit) Windows 11 Twin CAT BSD Additional software required .

Extensions Host • The domain name or IP address of the device on which the LDAP server is running. Port • Normally 389 for insecure connections and 636 for connections that use TLS. Use TLS • TLS should be used: this is highly recommended, especially when using "Simple" authentication. Trust all certificates • If disabled, the certificate of the LDAP Server is compared with the certificate store of the device on which the Twin CAT HMI Server is running. If enabled, the server certificate is not checked. It should only be used for test purposes. Even when self-signed certificates are used, this setting should be deactivated and the self-signed certificate should be added to the certificate store. Base DN • The distinguished name of the LDAP entry in which users can be searched for. Normally this only consists of domain components, e.g. "DC=Beckhoff,DC=com". For more information, see Distinguished Names. 1240 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1241

Extensions Synchronization interval • The user groups and the blocking status of active users are periodically synchronized with the LDAP directory server. The group memberships are adjusted and sessions of blocked users are terminated. An interval of PT0S means that synchronization only takes place during the login process. Timeout (advanced settings) • Network timeout for the connection to the LDAP server Follow Referrals (advanced settings) • Specifies whether the referrals returned by the LDAP server should be followed automatically. LDAP servers can return referrals to other LDAP servers, which may contain further search results. Compare attribute values taking into account upper/lower case (advanced settings) • Normally, LDAP attributes and DNs are not case-sensitive. However, there are a few cases in which it is useful to take upper/lower case into account. LDAP authentication Depending on the configuration of the LDAP server, the user profiles may not be public. In these cases, it is necessary to configure an administrative user account that is used for the directory search. Authentication mechanism for the bind user • If the user profiles are completely public, you do not need a bind user and you can select “None”. If the information is public, but anonymous binding is required to perform searches, you can select "Anonymous". If the user profiles are not public, you should enable TLS and use "Simple" authentication, or you can equally use the "Digest-MD5" mechanism. The "Kerberos credentials file" setting is also supported. If you select this setting, the user account that is currently logged in on the device that Twin CAT HMI Server is running on is used. Bind user DN TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1241
## Page 1242

Extensions • Normally the full Distinguished Name (DN) of the administrative user. If the LDAP server allows direct binding with a unique name attribute, such as the "user Principal Name", you can also use this attribute here. For more information, see Distinguished Names. Bind user password • The password of the administrative user. HMI authentication Authentication mechanism • Typically, the user wants to enable TLS and use the "simple" authentication mechanism. The "Digest- MD5" mechanism prevents the simple password being sent over the network, but is based on cryptographic algorithms that are no longer considered secure. 1242 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1243

Extensions User filter • The user filter is used in search queries to find the user profile based on the entries in the registration form. "{input}" is a placeholder that is replaced by the user's input in the registration form. "{username_attribute}" is a placeholder that is replaced by the configured attribute 'username', see format specification. The recommended settings are as follows: Microsoft Active Directory: (&({username_attribute}={input})(object Category=person)(object Class=user)) Open LDAP: (&({username_attribute}={input})(object Class=person))' or '(&({username_attribute}={input}) (object Class=inet Org Person)) User name attribute • LDAP attribute that is used in the USER_FILTER. Microsoft Active Directory servers usually use the "user Principal Name", while Open LDAP servers usually use the "uid" attribute. Useful documentation of the naming attributes supported by Microsoft Active Directory, see User Naming Attributes. Ignore the domain during login • Ignores everything after the first @ in the user name entered by the user. For example, if you use "user Principal Name" on Active Directory, you must deactivate this setting as the user Principal Name contains an @. Append the domain during login • For example, if “email” or “user Principal Name” is used for login, this setting can be used to automatically add the domain suffix so that it does not have to be specified during login. The extension checks the upper and lower case to determine whether the domain suffix already exists. Use LDAP search request for List Users • Depending on the size of the directory, the search may take too long or return too many results. If this setting is deactivated, the user names from the Tc Hmi Srv configuration are collected. This setting should be deactivated to improve performance. Group mappings Group mappings • The LDAP group must be assigned to a Twin CAT HMI group so that the LDAP user can log on to the HMI. By default, the System User rights are granted, and these should not normally be deleted. Block specific users • By default, all LDAP users can log in to the HMI and are assigned to the HMI user groups based on the groups. If you want to completely prevent authentication for certain users, you can block users based on LDAP attributes using the blacklist or whitelist. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1243
## Page 1244

Extensions Visible attributes • The names of the LDAP attributes that users can query from the LDAP directory entry linked to their account (e.g. user picture, room, telephone number). Cache for automatically added user groups (Advanced settings) • This cache is required to be able to correctly remove user groups that are configured based on group mappings. 12.7.3.1 Group mappings Establish the connection between the HMI user group and the LDAP user using attributes. LDAP attribute name • Name of the LDAP attribute LDAP attribute value • Value of the attribute. HMI user group • Name of the HMI group. 12.7.3.2 Block specific users Specify which user groups are blocked. 1244 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1245

Extensions Use whitelisting • If disabled, blacklisting is used. Add accounts affected by group mappings to the whitelist • Each group mapping is treated as a whitelist entry. 12.8 Reporting The Reporting Extension is an extension for creating report documents. Application scenario Report documents can later be used for batch tracking, quality management or further processing, for example. It is possible to create these documents as HTML or PDF/A. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1245

Extensions Architecture The extension is available with the Nu Get package Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Audit Trail >= 22.0.0. The package can be installed via Tc Pkg (Twin CAT. HMI. Audit Trail) or nuget.org. The Reporting Extension requires the Twin CAT. XAR. Reporting Server, which must be installed using Tc Pkg. 12.8.1 System requirements Version 1.14 Technical data Operating system Windows 10 (32/64-bit) Windows 11 Twin CAT BSD Additional software required Twin CAT. XAR. Reporting Server . NET Desktop Runtime 8 12.8.2 Licensing The Twin CAT Reporting Server is licensed via the TF2000 license, no additional license is required. 12.8.3 Quick start To start, create or open a Twin CAT HMI project. Installation Install the Nu Get package "Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Reporting" via the Nu Get Package Manager [} 1046]. 1246 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1247

Extensions The Twin CAT Reporting Server (Twin CAT. XAR. Reporting Server) is required to use the Reporting Extension. Install this using Tc Pkg if it is not available. Configuring the Reporting Extension 1. Open the configuration page of the Reporting Extension in Visual Studio or separately in the browser. 2. Go to the Reporting tab. ð You can configure the Reporting Extension here. The basic configuration of the report is carried out in the General area. Creating a new runtime: 1. Adjust the connection of the existing runtime or create a new one. 2. Connect this to a Twin CAT Reporting Server via the AMS Net Id of the target system. If it is an external Twin CAT Reporting Server, pay attention to the router configuration. 3. Create a new configuration. 4. Enter the desired name. ð You have now created a basic configuration for the Reporting Server. Creating a new report: 1. Create a new report. 2. Enter the desired name and connect the report with an associated runtime and configuration. 3. Create a new entry under Text fields. 4. Enter a name and the symbol to be read. ð This provides you with a basic configuration for creating a report. You can add elements such as tables, text fields or HTML containers to the report at any time. To create a report, at least one text field, table or HTML element must be included in the report. The PDF is created directly after the HTML page has been created. Anything delayed will result in an incorrect display. Example: If CSS animations are present in the background, they may not have been completed when the PDF is created. This results in an image being created at some point during the animation that does not correspond to the final result. This behavior can be found, for example, in the integration of charting libraries with animation. Creating a report file (HTML, PDF, JSON) You have the option of creating a report in the User-defined configuration area. 1. Under Reports, select the runtime of the Twin CAT Report Server on which you want to create the report. 2. Under Report generation, select the report to be created. 3. Click on the Create button in the Report generation group. ð The report is generated and displayed as an HTML file under Last report, if this has been configured. If no "Export path" is set, you will find the files on the Reporting Server system at C:\Program Files (x86)\Beckhoff\Twin CAT\Functions\Reporting-Server\Reports. 12.8.4 Configuration General The basic settings for the server extension are specified in the General tab.

This may be necessary if only certain areas are to be displayed in a separate report. Sample: In connection with the "Tc Hmi Audit Trail. Get Audit Trail" symbol, all values from the Audit Trail database are displayed. If a value is to be displayed from a certain timestamp, the filter would look as follows. "timestamp" >= "2025-04-17T10:45:34.4209685Z" If this filter is to be extended by a specific value, it would look as follows. "timestamp" >= "2025-04-17T10:45:34.4209685Z"&&"new Value" == "53" Limit: To limit the number of entries to a fixed value, a value can be entered here. The value 5 would mean that a maximum of five entries are transferred. Depending on the sort order and filter, the first entries are taken. Sort by: The entries in the symbol can be sorted using the sort function. Sample: In connection with the "Tc Hmi Audit Trail.

Filter [} 1266] (optional): Filter on specific values. Limit [} 1266] (optional): Maximum number of data to be displayed (number of rows). Sort by [} 1266] (optional): Specifies a sort order within the table. Title (optional): Heading of the text field. Value (optional): Editor for adding HTML code (without an entry, the value from the symbol is displayed). ð The value is read from the symbol and displayed. Sample HTML code (add text to symbol value) In the first step, the element in which the Java Script code is executed is retrieved. This is required to write the result in the appropriate place. The placeholder is integrated with {value}. In this case, it is a string, which is why it is in quotation marks. In the sample, the code block at the end is overwritten by the result of the function. <script> var script Tag = document.get Elements By Tag Name('script'); var parent = script Tag[script Tag.length - 1].parent Node; var value Full = "{value}"; parent.inner HTML = value Full + " Hello World!"; </script> Sample HTML code (temperature monitoring) The required HTML objects are embedded directly in this sample. Styles are used to format the appearance accordingly. In the Script area, Java Script is used to search for the required HTML objects in the first step. The current value is then evaluated. The Java Script switches the color of the integrated SVG and the value is output to two decimal places with a unit.

Extensions Installation Install the Nu Get package "Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Speech" via the Nu Get Package Manager [} 1046]. Establishing a connection The server must be announced first in Twin CAT Speech (see Documentation of Twin CAT Speech). Basic configuration By default, no Speech connection is established. For this purpose, a connection must be actively started by a Type Script/Java Script API call. Tc Hmi. Tc Speech.open Connection({ enable Microphone: true, enable Speaker: true }); Further possible parameters of the call with the respective default value are: default Volume: 1 This is the volume of the sound output when loading the application. This can be set from 0 to 1. domain: 'Tc Hmi Speech' Domain name under which the Speech Extension is reachable. confidence Threshold: 0.2 Each recognition event has a probability that the recognized text corresponds to the specified entry. This threshold value specifies the value from which this is treated as a genuine event. If, for example, 0.9 is specified here, an HMI event is only triggered in the case of a very precise match. (see also the Documentation from Microsoft) Use of recognized events in the project Recognized texts call events in the Speech system. These are transferred to the browser and can be used there in the same way as control events (such as my Button.on Click). The Recognition Tag from the SRGS file is taken here as the name. It can thus be used as an event in the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62] in the HMI. The name is entered in the Custom area for this purpose. If, for example, Speech On Command<SET_ENGLISH> is entered here, then an action is started on recognition of the Recognition Tag SET_ENGLISH. Use via Code Behind [} 1478] is also possible. Sample code with Type Script: Tc Hmi. Event Provider.register('Speech On Command<SET_ENGLISH>', (e, data: Tc Hmi. Tc Speech. IEvent Callback Parameter) => { // Will output: // 'The user said a text which triggered the recoginition tag: SET_ENGLISH' console.log('The user said a text which triggered the recoginition tag: ' + data. Command); if (data. Confidence > 0.9) { console.log('The speech recognition was pretty sure about that.'); } if (data. Parameter) { console.log('We got a parameter for this recognition: ', data. Parameter); } }); 12.10.3 Configuration General There are no parameters for the Speech Extension on the server configuration page. Set the connection in the Speech configuration. (see documentation of Twin CAT Speech). 1276 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Extensions 12.11 System Engineering System Engineering is an extension to support the setup of a machine. The extension automatically generates the mappings in the HMI server using variables marked with attributes in the PLC. The associated control automatically generates corresponding input buttons from the mappings. Application scenario The extension provides support when setting up a machine. • Machine parameters: parameter settings of a machine. All parameters are persisted in the extension and automatically written to the PLC when the extension is started. Sample using a standard machine With a standard machine, there are certain parameters that must be set for each machine individually during commissioning. These can be displayed via the machine parameters in the user interface, for example. In this case, the parameters are persisted in the extension and written to the PLC when the Twin CAT 3 HMI server is started. This allows for quick and easy commissioning or maintenance of the individual areas of the machine. The extension is available with the Nu Get package Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. System Engineering >= 22.0.0. The package can be installed via Tc Pkg (Twin CAT. HMI. System Engineering) or nuget.org. The control is available with the Nu Get package Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. System Engineering Utils >= 14.3.0. The package can be installed via Tc Pkg (Twin CAT. HMI. System Engineering Utils) or nuget.org. 12.11.1 System requirements Version 1.14 Technical data Operating system Windows 10 (32/64-bit) Windows 11 Twin CAT BSD Additional software required - TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1277

Extensions Special features Link variable to attributes As it is not always possible to specify a fixed value, e.g. for the minimum and maximum value, it is possible to bind these to a variable. Access to a variable at the same structure level: FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Machine VAR {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Name' := 'Label Speed'} {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Unit' := 'mm/1'} {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Min' := '@n Min Speed'} {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Max' := '@n Max Speed'} n Speed : REAL; n Min Speed : REAL := 0; n Max Speed : REAL := 3000; END_VAR Access to a variable in a substructure: FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Machine Unit VAR {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Name' := 'Inspection'} {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Tree View Image' := '@this._s Image'} _fb Inspection : FB_Inspection Unit; END_VAR FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Inspection Unit VAR {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter.

## Page 1284

Extensions Placeholder attributes can be defined using so-called preset attributes. These can be used in substructures of function blocks. This is necessary, for example, if the attribute declarations have been made within a library function block. Function blocks that are in a library cannot be changed in the project. By declaring the placeholder in the variable, the value is transferred to the function block. In the case of multiple initialization, the preset variables can be used, for example, to create a separate name for each individual function block. FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Machine VAR {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter. Name' := 'Cut Cylinder'} {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Preset. Informations' := 'Cut Cylinder'} _fb Cut Cylinder : FB_Cylinder; END_VAR FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Cylinder VAR_INPUT {attribute 'Tc Hmi System Eng. Parameter.

Extensions Runtimes Several runtimes can be created under Runtimes. A runtime is the connection to a PLC. Enabled • Enables access to the runtime. ADS runtime • Selection of runtime from the ADS extension [} 1114]. All available runtimes from the ADS extension are made available here in the dropdown. Automatic symbol update • Automatically checks the PLC for changes and updates the symbols. Mapping the symbols can take some time. It is therefore recommended to set this to FALSE for small changes to the PLC that do not affect “Tc Hmi System Eng.*”. Enable audit trail • Uses audit trail for the historization of symbols. Entry path • Set the level from which the PLC is to be searched. The smaller the structure to be searched, the less time is required. Symbol for initialization status • Configure an initialization bit to see whether the initial values have been written to the PLC. If the bit in the PLC is set to FALSE, this triggers the persisted data to be written to the PLC again. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1285
## Page 1286

Extensions The values persisted in the extension are initially written to the PLC when the HMI server is started. 12.11.6 Controls The following controls are available for the System Engineering Extension.

Using server-to-server communication, any data points can be exchanged between the servers. The prerequisite for this is that the symbols are mapped on the target server. [} 80] Server-to-server communication can be used in different scenarios. For example, it is possible for a server to tap the data points of any number of subordinate servers. It is also possible for one server to pass the data points on to another server, which in turn passes the data on to the next server. 1452 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1453

Server Server-to-server communication requires a client license (TF2010 - TF2040) on the server to which another server wants to connect. In the scenario shown above, Twin CAT HMI Server 1, Twin CAT HMI Server 2 and Twin CAT HMI Server n require a client license if the higher-level Twin CAT HMI Server connects to them. Available since version 1.10.1336.0 13.2.1 Configure connection Server-to-server communication is set up on the configuration page [} 957] of the Twin CAT HMI server. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1453
## Page 1454

Server Add Remote Server 1. Open the configuration page of the server and navigate to the subpage Tc Hmi Srv → Webserver: 2. Under Remote Server, you can add a server that you want to connect to. Click on the entry + Add. Configuring the Remote Server The connection to the remote server can be configured as follows: 1. Domain: The domain can be chosen freely. The remote server is listed in Twin CAT HMI under this name. 2. Remote URL: URL of the remote server. The complete address of the remote server must be specified here, including the protocol to be used. Using encrypted communication requires adding the certificate [} 1455] of the remote server. 3. Username (optional): The user name is required if authentication [} 964] is active on the remote server. Depending on the configured symbol rights [} 974], the different users have different access rights to the symbols. It is possible to log another user on to the remote server at runtime [} 1455]. If authentication is disabled on the remote server, the user does not need to enter anything. 4. Password (optional): Password of the user logged on to the remote server. 1454 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1455

Server 5. Timeout (optional): Web Socket timeout for communication with the remote server. 6. Enabled: Enables or disables the connection to the remote server. 7. Add: Adds the connection to the remote server. 13.2.1.1 Add remote server certificate Communication with the remote server can be encrypted. In this case, the SSL certificate of the remote server must be exported and imported to the server that wants to connect to the remote server. 1. Export the certificate of the remote server. Open the configuration page of the remote server and click on "Export SSL Certificate". 2. Open the configuration page of the server you want to connect to the remote server. 3. Navigate under "Tc Hmi Srv" to the tab "Webserver" and click on the entry "Allowed certificates for remote servers". 4. Add a new certificate by clicking on the entry "+ Add". 5. Select the certificate of the remote server you want to import. 6. Confirm the dialog by clicking on "Add". 13.2.1.2 Changing the Configuration at Runtime The configuration of the remote server can be changed at runtime. This makes it possible, for example, to log on to the remote server with another user and thus obtain different access rights to the symbols of the remote server. Access at runtime is via the Config symbol of the Twin CAT HMI server. Under the Config symbol you will find the configuration of the remote server, which contains the same options as the configuration page of the server. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1455
## Page 1456

Server When mapping the symbols [} 80], the domain must be specified (e.g. My Remote Server). The symbols can then be described and read in the Actions and Conditions editor [} 66]. 13.2.2 Use data points After the connection has been configured, the mapped symbols of the remote server can be accessed. Access is via the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window [} 78] via the domain of the remote server. There the symbols can be used in the same way as with the other extensions [} 109]. The symbols can be mapped via the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window. Activating the extended view [} 78] (button "...") displays the extended mapped symbols of the remote server. 1456 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Server 13.3 Extensions The Twin CAT HMI Server has a modular structure and encapsulates individual functionalities in server extensions. This enables a flexible expandability of the server. This can be used, for example, to integrate business logic centrally in the server and to protect know-how. Possible application scenarios are, for example, the connection to a user-specific database or the implementation of communication protocols. The development of server extensions is done in C#. The development takes place in a separate project type within the Visual Studio. A corresponding project template is available for this purpose. The execution of a server extension on the Twin CAT HMI server (TF2000) requires a license for the extension SDK (TF2200). The development of a server extension requires a full version [} 20] of Visual Studio. 13.3.1 First steps In addition to the Twin CAT HMI project, add another Server Extension project to your solution: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1457
## Page 1458

Server In the following dialog you can choose which server version should be used for development: 1458 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1459

Server If the project was compiled successfully, the extension can be loaded from the server. Open the context menu in the Twin CAT HMI project under Server/Extensions: Activate the respective extension to be loaded from the Engineering Server: The server tries to load the extension. The state of the loaded extension is symbolized in the project node Server/Extensions: If a problem has occurred during loading, the error list or log from the server can help with error analysis. After loading the extension, the extension symbols are available in the Twin CAT HMI Config window: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1459

Server 13.4 Automap Symbols Variables from the PLC can be automatically mapped in the human-machine interface using the automap function. To do this, attributes must be set on the relevant variables in the PLC. The HMI searches the existing ADS symbols and creates them automatically if the relevant attribute is present. Available attributes: Attributes Description Version 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol' Mapping the variables in the HMI using >= 1.12.756.1 the automap function. 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol. Ignore' Ignore the variables; underlying variables >= 1.14.x.x with Add Symbol attribute are still mapped. 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol. Ignore Recursively' Ignore the variables and the underlying >= 1.14.x.x variables. 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol. Hidden' Hides the mapping (only visible when >= 1.12.756.1 extended symbols are displayed). 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol. User Groups' Creates a read/write authorization for >= 1.12.756.1 user groups. 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol. User Groups. Read' Creates a read authorization for user >= 1.14.x.x groups. Example – ST (variable declaration in the PLC) Adding a variable { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol' } _i : INT; Adding a variable that is hidden in the human-machine interface { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol' } { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol. Hidden' } _i : INT; Adding a variable, with read/write authorization for two user groups { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol' } { attribute 'Tc Hmi Symbol. Add Symbol. User Groups' := '__System Administrators,Operators' } _i : INT; 1460 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Server Adding the automap symbols in Visual Studio/Tc Xae Shell 1. Open the Twin CAT HMI Configuration window. 2. Go to the Server Symbols / All Symbols tab. 3. Right-click on ADS. 4. Start the automatic mapping via Map Automap Symbols. ð After adding, a message about the number of symbols added or an error message appears. A maximum of 1000 symbols are currently mapped via Visual Studio/Tc Xae Shell. Adding the automap symbols via Java Script 1. Add a new Java Script file to the project. 2. Open the Java Script file you have created. 3. Call up the write Ex function and describe the Add Symbols symbol. ð Automatic mapping of symbols is started by describing the symbol. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1461

["ADS. PLC1. MAIN._axis"] skip Existing boolean Only symbols that do not yet exist are >= 1.12.756.1 created. limit int32 Limits the number of symbols that are >= 1.14.x.x searched for. Example – Java Script (start Automap Symbols, minimal data for request): Tc Hmi. Symbol.write Ex('%s%Add Symbols|Timeout=5000%/s%', {domain: "ADS"}, function (data) { // callback value console.log(data); // number of found symbols console.log(Object.keys(data?.value).length); }); Example – Java Script (start Automap Symbols): let config = { domain: "ADS", path: "PLC1::MAIN::_fb Machine", name Prefix: "Auto Mapp.", dry Run: false, ignore Problems: false, ignore: [ "ADS. PLC1. MAIN._axis" ], skip Existing: true, limit: 3000 } Tc Hmi. Symbol.write Ex('%s%Add Symbols|Timeout=5000%/s%', config, function (data) { // callback value console.log(data); // number of found symbols console.log(Object.keys(data?.value).length); }); This functionality is available since version 1.12.756.1. This functionality is only available with an ADS connection and not with a TMC file. The attributes do not currently work for methods or properties. 1462 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14 Framework Twin CAT HMI can be extended in the client via script language. The client is implemented via web technology (see Web Technology Reference at MDN). Besides the Twin CAT HMI API, the application developer can also use the other browser APIs. The main API that is required is the Java Script DOM API. Java Script tutorials: • https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials • https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn 14.1 Script languages in the HMI project Scripting languages enable the client-side extension of a Twin CAT HMI project with complex logics that cannot be mapped using the engineering functions. The scripting languages provide the developer with all options and functions of the respective scripting language. In addition, the scripting languages provide access to the framework API. In addition to the Java Script script language, version 1.12 makes the Type Script programming language available for development purposes. Type Script code is converted to Java Script code by the Type Script transpiler. Type Script offers many advantages over Java Script thanks to typification and the Type Script syntax. This enables many errors to be detected at an early stage during development, making source code development easier and faster. A distinction is made between three types of usage: 1. Action [} 1467]: An action consists of Java Script code that can only be used within the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62]. Application: Execution of simple Java Script functionalities. Info: No Type Script support. 2. Functions [} 1471]: A function consists of Type Script/Java Script code and an associated description and is added separately to a project. Application: Execution of Type Script/Java Script in the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62] and in the Properties [} 61] window. 3. Code-Behind [} 1478]: Code-Behind consists of Type Script/Java Script code and is added to a project as a separate file. Application: Execution of complex Type Script/Java Script code. Java Script is supported from version 1.8, Type Script from version 1.12. See also Type Script documentation 14.1.1 Action 14.1.1.1 Create An action is configured in the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62] for an event. To do this, open any event and insert a Java Script action in the Actions and Conditions Editor using drag & drop. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1467
## Page 1468

Framework A Java Script action consists of the following elements: 1 Edit Source Code: Clicking this button opens the Embedded Java Script Editor, where the Java Script statements can be programmed. 2 Wait mode: In this combo box you can select whether the Java Script block is executed synchronously or asynchronously [} 1469]. 3 Inject context object: When selecting the checkbox a context object (ctx) [} 1470] is available within the Java Script code, which can be used to provide feedback about the end of an action. The context object is evaluated via a success branch or an error branch [} 1469], which can be shown or hidden by right-clicking on the action. 14.1.1.2 Editor The editor for Java Script actions offers the option to program and edit the Java Script code. After programming, save the Java Script code by clicking the OK button. 1468 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1469

Framework The Java Script code within the Java Script action is interpreted when the action is executed. Depending on the event, the action can be executed several times. Variables and functions declared in an action are only available within the action. Internal variables [} 88] can be read via the framework API. 14.1.1.3 Use Java Script actions are typically used for simple Java Script logics that have no major connection to other functionalities in the project. The use of a Code-Behind file [} 1478] is recommended in cases where several Java Script actions are configured, since the code is available centrally in one place, i.e. not distributed across several places. Typical use cases • Logging messages to the browser console • Output of info messages in popup windows for debugging purposes • Calling simple framework API functions Special statements • Breakpoint: debugger; This statement sets a breakpoint at the current location and stops the program when the development tools of the browser [} 1600] are open. 14.1.1.4 Wait mode Via the wait mode options of the Java Script action, the Twin CAT HMI framework can be informed whether the stored logic works synchronously or asynchronously; it is used to determine when the Twin CAT HMI framework considers execution to be finished. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1469
## Page 1470

Framework Synchronous The execution of the action is considered finished when the last line of Java Script source code has been processed synchronously. If an exception occurs during execution, the error branch of the Java Script action is executed. If the execution completed without errors, the success branch of the Java Script action is executed. The Wait for completion option has no effect for a synchronous logic. "Parallel" execution of synchronous logic, even in parts, is not possible. Asynchronous The execution of the action is considered completed if this has been signaled using the corresponding functions of a context object. If Inject context object is checked, an object with the name "ctx [} 1470]" is inserted into the context of the Java Script block. This object contains functions for communicating the execution result. If the success function is called, the success branch of the Java Script action is executed. If the error function is called, the error branch of the Java Script action is executed. The error branch of the Java Script action is also executed if an exception occurs during execution. With asynchronous logic, the Wait for completion option can be used to control whether the execution result is to be awaited when the subsequent actions are executed or whether they are to be executed in parallel with the Java Script action. 14.1.1.4.1 Context An asynchronous Java Script [} 1467] trigger action must notify the context object (ctx) of success or failure of the execution. The context object has appropriate functions for this. success Indicates successful execution. ctx.success("Result"); 1470 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1471

Framework error Indicates unsuccessful execution. ctx.error(Tc Hmi. Errors. ERROR); 14.1.2 Function 14.1.2.1 Create Create a new function via the project node of the Twin CAT HMI project. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1471
## Page 1472

Framework A function can be created based on Type Script or Java Script. Both have the same technical options and are very similar in terms of programming. Due to the better Visual Studio programming support offered by Visual Studio, Type Script should be selected for new functions. Enter a name for the file. A function consists of a Type Script/Java Script file and an associated JSON file, which defines engineering properties. Double-click the JSON file in the Solution Explorer to configure [} 1472] the function and its parameters. 14.1.2.2 Editor The function and parameter editor is divided into a function and parameter area. 1472 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1473

Framework Function area: 1 Display name: Name of the function used [} 1474] in the Actions and Conditions Editor or in the Properties window. 2 Description: Description of the function that is displayed as a tooltip during mouseover in the engineering. 3 Return type: Return value of the function that is transferred to the calling point in the engineering. 4 Context: The context defines whether the function synchronous (None) or asynchronous (Asynchronous) [} 1469] is executed. Asynchronous automatically adds a context object [} 1478] as a parameter value to the function. 5 Internal name: Internal name of the function used in the Java Script file. 6 Category: The category determines under which category the function is displayed in the Actions and Conditions Editor. 7 Return value description: Description of the return value that is displayed as a tooltip during mouseover in the engineering. Parameter area: 8 Display name: Name of the parameter used [} 1474] in the Actions and Conditions Editor or in the Properties window. 9 Internal name: Internal name of the parameter used in the Java Script file. 10 Description: Description of the parameter that is displayed as a tooltip during mouseover in the engineering. 11 Data type: Data type of the parameter. 12 Default value: Default value of the parameter that is used if no parameter is transferred. 13 Required: Indicates whether the parameter is required or can be transferred optionally. If the parameter is required and is not transferred, an error message is issued in the browser console. 14 Bindable: Bindable indicates whether the parameter can be bound to a symbol via the Select Binding Source window [} 109]. The following options are available: • No: The parameter cannot be bound to a symbol. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1473
## Page 1474

Framework • Yes, pass value: The parameter can be bound to a symbol. During binding, the value of the symbol is passed to the function (e.g. "20" for an integer). • Yes, pass symbol reference: The parameter can be bound to a symbol. During binding, the reference to the symbol is passed to the function. The symbol can be read (.read()) and written (.write()) via the framework API "Tc Hmi. Symbol". 15 Rest: Rest indicates whether the last parameter is a rest parameter (var n Number,...) and can therefore contain a variable list of arguments (cf. va_arg / va_list in C / C++). Changes (e.g. newly added parameters) in the function and parameter editor can be automatically applied to the corresponding Java Script file. The automatic application can be confirmed or rejected via a dialog. 14.1.2.3 Use Functions allow the execution of Java Script code that can be linked directly from the Properties window [} 61] in the engineering component or used within the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62]. This makes it possible to pass parameters to the function via the engineering. Typical use cases • Conversion: Conversion of values within a function, e.g. conversion of units. • Validation: Checking of values within a function and feedback on the validity of the value. Several functions are already available [} 71] in the Twin CAT HMI engineering. To obtain an overview of the functions, open the "Functions" folder in the Actions and Conditions Editor. 14.1.2.3.1 Using HMI functions Functions that have been created are available for graphical programming in the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62] under Functions. 1474 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1475

Framework In addition, the Control Properties functions can be used directly in the Properties window [} 61]. They can be found via Intelli Sense. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1475
## Page 1476

Framework 14.1.2.4 Structure A function is implemented within the "Tc Hmi" namespace. Implementation outside the namespace is not possible, since otherwise the function would not be available in the Twin CAT HMI framework. The function is registered in the framework via the framework API function "register Function Ex" (since version 1.12) or "register Function" so that it is available at runtime. The following sample implements the conversion of a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and returns the calling point.

The context object has appropriate functions for this. success Indicates successful execution. ctx.success("Result"); error Indicates unsuccessful execution. ctx.error(Tc Hmi. Errors. ERROR); 14.1.2.4.2 Using a function within a function Within a Java Script function, the Twin CAT HMI can use another Java Script function. To do this, a reference to the function must be created via the framework API. The function can be used once its validity has been verified. // get user function var my Custom Function1 = Tc Hmi. Functions.get Function('My Custom Function1'); // check if the reference is valid if (my Custom Function1) { var my Parameter = "Sample"; // function call var output = my Custom Function1(my Parameter); // ... } 14.1.3 Code-behind 14.1.3.1 Create A code-behind file can be added at the project level or in a project folder. Any number of code-behind files can be added to the project. A Code-Behind file can be created based on Type Script or Java Script. Both have the same technical options and are very similar in terms of programming. Due to the better Visual Studio programming support offered by Visual Studio, Type Script should be selected for new functions. 1478 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework Right-click the target node and click Add New Item. Select a code-behind file. The Code-Behind file can be opened by double-clicking in the source code editor. Code-behind sort order If you have added several code-behind files to the project, it is possible to specify the order in the build process and thus during inclusion within the HTML file of the HMI. This is necessary if dependencies exist within the individual files. Right-click on the project node of the HMI project and select Code Behind Sort Order and Theme Assignment. Within the editor, the sort order can be defined under the Java Script Files tab. The order can be changed using the Up and Down buttons. The browsers only support Java Script files. The generated Java Script file is therefore displayed in this window. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1479

Framework 14.1.3.2 Use A code-behind file can be used for Java Script functionalities that are to apply globally to the entire project. Control events can be registered independently of the HMI side, based on the control ID. Therefore, a code- behind file is particularly suitable for mapping complex functionalities with Java Script that cannot be performed using the graphical engineering. Typical applications • Summary of functionalities: Identical event configurations can be combined in a code-behind file and stored in functions to avoid redundancies (see Action Templates [} 72] in the Actions and Conditions Editor). • Global variables: Saving of data used in multiple events to a global variable (see internal symbols [} 88] in the Configuration window). • Evaluation of complex objects (e.g. JSON): Processing, validating and evaluating objects. • Using the framework API: Access to the framework API functions, which cannot be executed via the graphical engineering. • Dynamic elements: Adding or removing dynamic elements at runtime (e.g. dynamically generate controls at runtime, see Control Factory). • Responsive design: Querying the current browser width, switching of grid configurations and loading of different pages depending on the browser width. • Evaluating URL parameters: Loading different views depending on the browser URL. • Disabling client interactions: Disabling interactions with other clients via the session ID of the browser. 14.1.3.3 Structure A newly added code-behind file contains pre-configured Java Script code. The commentary lines (triple slash directives) are required for enhanced support of Intelli Senese in Java Script: // Tc Hmi Version 1.12 /// <reference path="../Packages/Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI.

Framework Engineering\Infrastructure\Tc Hmi Framework\Latest\Lib\jquery\jquery.js" /> /// <reference path="C:\Twin CAT\Functions\TE2000-HMI- Engineering\Infrastructure\Tc Hmi Framework\Latest\Tc Hmi.js" /> The Java Script code that is implemented within a code-behind file must be implemented within the Tc Hmi namespace. (function ( /** @type {global This. Tc Hmi} */ Tc Hmi) { // code })(Tc Hmi); The Twin CAT HMI framework is not available outside the namespace! In a new code-behind file the global on Initialized event is registered by the framework as an example. Here you can place actions that are to be executed after the initialization of the framework. // If you want to unregister an event outside the event code you need to use the return value of the method register() var destroy On Initialized = Tc Hmi. Event Provider.register('on Initialized', function (e, data) { // This event will be raised only once, so we can free resources. // It's best practice to use destroy function of the event object within the callback function to avoid conflicts. e.destroy(); // ---------------------- // Place your code here! // ---------------------- }); Within the code-behind file any events can be registered and deregistered. The registration of Twin CAT HMI framework events is realized via the Event Provider framework API. Registration via the Event Provider registers a callback to the event and returns a function for deregistering the event. The function for deregistering the event should be called to release system resources when the event is no longer needed (for example, Event Listener for a Mouse Over event). destroy On Initialized(); Control events are registered using the Control ID (e.g. Tc Hmi Button.on Pressed). A control event can be registered in several places. If an event is registered in the code-behind file, it is not displayed in the Designer under Events. It is therefore advisable to either register an event in a code-behind file or to configure it in the Designer for enhanced clarity. 14.2 Extensions 14.2.1 obsolete syntax (version 1.8 and 1.10) 14.2.1.1 Controls Java Script is supported from version 1.8. 14.2.1.1.1 Introduction Framework controls are user-specific controls that are not created with the graphical WYSIWYG editor [} 37]. Framework controls are used if the desired behavior cannot be mapped with the standard controls or a user control. Unlike a Code Behind file [} 1478], a framework control can be used independently of the HMI project, so that the source code can be reused. Technology Framework controls are developed using web development tools. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1481
## Page 1482

Framework • HTML: Type and structure of the elements of the framework control • CSS: Design of the elements of the framework control • Java Script: Logic behind the elements of the framework control Developers are no longer bound to the Twin CAT HMI controls and can use all the elements and functionalities they are already familiar with from web development within a framework control. The standard Twin CAT HMI controls are implemented on the same basis as a framework control. It is also possible to reuse the Twin CAT HMI controls in the framework control or to add user-specific properties. Application scenarios Framework controls can map customer-specific and application-specific requirements. The following use cases can be implemented with a framework control: • Implementation of complex Java Script logic • Reusing HTML, JS and CSS in a control • Integration of external libraries and realization of own libraries • Dynamic elements: Adding and removing HTML elements and controls at runtime • Developing responsive controls • Realizing and integrating 3D models Use The framework controls can be integrated directly as references in a Twin CAT HMI project if both projects are in the same solution. Furthermore, it is possible to export the framework control as a package [} 1026] and install it in different HMI projects. In this way, it is possible to implement application-specific control libraries. Within the HMI project, a framework control is used like a standard Twin CAT HMI control. 14.2.1.1.2 First steps 1. Open Visual Studio and click Add new project. Select the Extensibility category under Twin CAT HMI as the project type. 1482 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 6. If you have opened a View/Content/User Control file, you have to reload the page. This is illustrated by a note. Click Reload. ð The framework control is now available in the toolbox. 7. Use drag & drop to add the framework control to an open View/Content/User Control file. ð You can now use the framework control like a normal control. All changes in the source code of the framework control require a project build (see step 2) to ensure that the changes are adopted in the Engineering. 14.2.1.1.3 Development environment A framework control project is created within a solution in Visual Studio. Multiple framework control projects and associated HMI projects can be placed in a solution. A framework control project can be configured using the standard Visual Studio functions (for example, Build Solution). A framework control project contains the following elements when it is created: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1485
## Page 1486

Please note from version 1.8 To program framework controls, a full version of Visual Studio is required for editing the HTML, CSS, and Java Script code. The Visual Studio shell is not sufficient. 14.2.1.1.4 Properties 14.2.1.1.4.1 Description.json This section describes the structure of the description file Description.json. 1486 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1487

Framework Any changes in Description.json must be followed by a project build (see First Steps [} 1482]). 14.2.1.1.4.1.1 Introduction Twin CAT HMI Engineering reads all properties of the control from the Description.json file. The properties allow you to transfer data to the control and vice versa. In Twin CAT HMI Engineering, the control can be configured via the Properties window [} 61] or via the Actions and Conditions editor. The developer can define additional attributes, besides the standard attributes of each framework control. Description.json must correspond to a given JSON schema. The schema is located in the framework control project under Schema/Control/Description.json. The schema must not be changed. It is used to describe the syntax in Description.json. In many cases the following user-specific properties are defined in Description.json: • Attributes [} 1492] (data interfaces) • Functions [} 1498] • Events [} 1500] • Access rights [} 1501] • User-specific data types [} 1501] 14.2.1.1.4.1.2 Properties Type: Specifies the data type of the property. Required: Specifies whether the property is required for the framework control (yes) or is optional (no). 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.1 $schema Type: String (relative path) Required: No "$schema": "./Schema/Control Description. Schema.json" This property references the JSON schema that describes the structure of Description.json. The schema is located in the framework control project and does not have to be changed. Including the JSON schema enables Intellisense in Visual Studio for each property. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.2 name Type: String Required: Yes "name": "framework-control-js1" This property is the name of the framework control, which is automatically generated based on the project name.

## Page 1489

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.9 base Type: String Required: Yes "base": "tchmi-control" This property determines whether the control inherits the properties of another control. By default, a framework control inherits all properties of Description.json of the base control tchmi-control, which defines a base framework for all Twin CAT HMI controls. The control can be made to inherit from other controls, such as a button, if a particular control is to be extended. The control name to be specified here corresponds to the control type or control name defined in Description.json [} 1487]. Validity This property must refer to a valid control and must not have the value null, otherwise the control can no longer be used in the Engineering. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.10 uses Type: Array of strings Required: No "uses": [] This property defines a list of controls that are used in this control (static or dynamic at runtime). This property references the Java Script and stylesheet files of the controls used in this control. By default, no other controls are used. The base control [} 1489] does not have to be referenced again. If other controls are used in this control, the control type or name of the control [} 1487] defined in Description.json must be specified. The following listing shows an example of a framework control that uses the Tc Hmi Button and a user-specific control: "uses": [ "tchmi-button", "tchmi-my-framework-control" ] For more information about using controls in a framework control, see Examples. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.11 description Type: String Required: Yes "description": "This description text will be used as a Tooltip in Visual Studio." This property is the description of the control and is displayed as a tooltip when the mouse is moved over the control in the toolbox. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.12 default Designer Event Type: String Required: No "default Designer Event": "" This property determines which event is to be configured in the Actions and Conditions Editor when the control is double-clicked. By default (no entry or empty entry), no event is executed on double-clicking. All standard and custom events defined in Description.json can be used here. The following listing shows an example of a custom event: "default Designer Event": ".on My Custom Event" Custom events are defined under events [} 1500]. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1489

Framework ] } } 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17 attributes Type: Array of JSON objects (attributes) Required: Yes "attributes": [ { "name": "data-tchmi-value", "property Name": "Value", "property Setter Name": "set Value", "property Getter Name": "get Value", "display Name": "Value", "visible": true, "themeable": "Standard", "display Priority": 10, "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean", "category": "Value", "description": "", "read Only": false, "bindable": true, "heritable": true, "default Value": false, "default Value Internal": false } ] The attributes define the data interfaces to the Twin CAT HMI Engineering. The attributes of the control are displayed in the Properties window of the Engineering under "Show Properties". Any number of attributes can be defined in a control. By default, the attribute array contains the type attribute that is required for each control and must not be removed. This attribute specifies that the control is of type tchmi-framework-control-js1: { "name": "data-tchmi-type", "display Name": "", "property Name": "type", "property Setter Name": "", "property Getter Name": "get Type", "visible": false, "type": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Control Type", "category": "None", "description": "Type of the control.", "required On Compile": true, "read Only": true, "bindable": false, "heritable": false, "default Value": "framework-control-js1", "default Value Internal": null } The individual properties of an attribute are described on the following pages. Type: Specifies the data type of the property. Required: Specifies whether the property is required for the attribute (yes) or is optional (no). 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 name Type: String Required: Yes "name": "data-tchmi-value" Name of the attribute. The name is written into the HMTL code of the control as a "data-*" attribute. Therefore, the "data-" prefix is mandatory. The subsequent prefix "tchmi-" before the attribute is recommended for standardizing attributes, but it is not obligatory. An attribute name may only be used once for each control, otherwise unambiguous assignment cannot be guaranteed. 1492 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1493

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.2 property Name Type: String Required: Yes "property Name": "Value" Internal attribute name of the control. The internal attribute name is formed from the attribute name without prefix in Pascal case. Example: "name": "data-tchmi-my-custom-value" becomes: „My Custom Value“. For better mapping between Java Script variables and attributes, it is recommended to name the attribute variable in the Java Script code of Source.js according to the "property Name". 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.3 property Setter Name Type: String Required: Yes "property Setter Name": "set Value" This property creates the reference to the setter function in Source.js. The setter function allows a new value to be set. For the reference between Description.json and Source.js, the setter function must have the same name as the"property Setter Name". If the names in Description.json and Source.js are different, an error message appears in the browser console and the setter function cannot be used. The recommended notation for the setter name is the "property Name" plus the prefix "set" in Camel case. If an attribute is read only [} 1496], the empty string should be entered as property Setter Name. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.4 property Getter Name Type: String Required: Yes "property Getter Name": "get Value" This property creates the reference to the getter function in Source.js. The getter function returns the attribute value when called. For the reference between Description.json and Source.js, the getter function must have the same name as the"property Getter Name". If the names in Description.json and Source.js are different, an error message appears in the browser console and the getter function cannot be used. The recommended notation for the getter name is the "property Name" plus the prefix "get" in Camel case. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.5 display Name Type: String Required: Yes "display Name": "Value" The property is the name of the attribute displayed in the Engineering Properties window for the attribute. The "display Name" can be selected as desired, but it is recommended that it should be based on the "property Name". 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.6 ref To Type: String Required: No "ref To": "base Property Name" TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1493
## Page 1494

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 display Priority 1 Type: Number Required: No "display Priority": 10 This property determines the priority with which the attribute is displayed within the category in the Engineering Properties window. User-specific sorting of attributes is possible based on the priority. Attributes with the same priority are displayed according to the order in which they are defined. The prioritization of the attribute categories is set via the property "attribut Categories [} 1497]". • Values less than 10 have high priority and are displayed higher up in the category, according to the value. • Values that equal 10 have main attributes like top, left etc. • Values greater than 10 have low priority and are displayed lower down in the category, according to the value. • Values greater than 50 are collapsed by default and have to be expanded using the arrow. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 allowed Functions 2 Type: JSON object Required: No "allowed Functions": { "return Type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/String", "required Arguments": [ { "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Number" } ], "required Wait Mode": "Synchronous" } For attributes with the data type [} 1494]: "type": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Function" These properties can only be used for "Function" type attributes. This property determines which functions are allowed for the attribute. This means that when configuring the attribute, only those functions are displayed that meet the defined criteria. Further parameters are possible and can be specified per instance in the engineering. Attributes: • return Type {string}: Determines which Twin CAT HMI data type may be returned by the function. • required Arguments {array of JSON objects}: Determines which Twin CAT HMI data types the functions may have as parameter values. The parameters mentioned here are set by the control. • required Wait Mode {enum string}: Determines in which mode (synchronous, asynchronous) the function may be executed (Synchronous, Asynchronous). For example, one the Beckhoff controls that uses this property is Linear Gauge [} 433], namely for the Value Format [} 455] in order to restrict the functions that can format the values of the gauge. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 category 3 Type: String Required: No "category": "Value" TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1495
## Page 1496

Framework This property indicates the category to which the attribute is assigned in the Engineering Properties window. New category names can be assigned or standard category names (e.g. Common) can be used. A new category name does not have to exist under the Attribute categories [} 1497], since the category is created independently of the attribute categories. The attribute categories are used to prioritize different attribute categories. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 description 4 Type: String Required: No "description": "This description text will be used as a Tooltip in Visual Studio." This property contains the description of the attribute, which is displayed as a tooltip when the mouse is moved over the attribute. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 required On Compile 5 Type: Boolean Required: No "required On Compile": false This property determines whether the attribute of the control is required when the HMI is compiled. If the attribute is required for the control and the property is not set, an error message is issued and the control is not valid. This property is normally not required for attributes of a framework control. An example for "required On Compile" is id and data-tchmi-type of a control. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 read Only 6 Type: Boolean Required: No "read Only": false This property indicates whether the Engineering has write access to the attribute or only read access. By default, write access to an attribute is available. If read Only is set to true, the attribute is no longer displayed in the Engineering Properties window, but it can still be used via the Actions and Conditions Editor. For read only attributes, the property Setter Name [} 1493] is not required and can be replaced by an empty string. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 bindable 7 Type: Boolean Required: No "bindable": true This property indicates whether a data Binding [} 109] to the attribute can be created in the Engineering. By default, the property is true. If the property is set to false, it is not possible to link symbols to the attribute. Nevertheless, this attribute can be used and read at another location. 1496 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1497

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 heritable 8 Type: Boolean Required: No "heritable": true This property indicates whether the attribute can be passed on to other control. By default, the property is true. If the property is set to false, it is not available in the derived control classes. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.1 default Value 9 Type: Data type of the attribute Required: No "default Value": false This property indicates the default value for the attribute that is used in the Engineering Properties window when instantiating the control and written to the HTML code. If null is entered here, no attribute is set. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.17.2 default Value Internal 0 Type: Data type of the attribute Required: No "default Value Internal": false This property indicates the internal default value for the attribute that can be used in Source.js. The internal default value may differ from the normal default value [} 1497]. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.18 attribute Categories Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "attribute Categories": [ { "name": "Value", "display Priority": 500, "default Collapsed": false, "description": "" } ] The property is used to prioritize new attribute categories that are assigned under Attributes [} 1495]. Prioritization is used to determine the displayed order of the categories in the Engineering Properties window. The attribute categories are described within a JSON object. The following properties can be defined: • name {String}: The name of the attribute category. The attribute name must be assigned to at least one control attribute. • display Priority {Number}: The priority determines the order in which the various attribute categories are displayed within the Engineering Properties window. ◦ Values less than 10 mean high priority and are displayed at the top of the Properties window (e.g. colors). ◦ Values less than 500 have standard categories (e.g. Common =100, Layout = 200, Border = 300, Background Image = 400). ◦ Values greater than 500 should be assigned user-specific categories so that they are listed below the standard categories. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1497
## Page 1498

Framework ◦ Values greater than 800 have low priority and are rarely configured. • default Collapsed {Boolean}, not required: This property determines whether the category is collapsed by default (true) or expanded (false). • description {String}, not required: Optional description of the attribute category that is displayed as a tooltip for the mouseover event in the Engineering. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.19 themed Resources Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "themed Resources": [ { "name": "My Custom Themed Resource", "display Name": "My Custom Themed Resource", "description": "This is a custom themed resource. Look at theming of framework controls.", "type": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/My Themed Definition" } ] This property contains all user-specific theme definitions that are not defined as attributes in the Engineering Properties window and can only be changed using the theme editor. An example of a "Themed Resource" are images within a control that cannot be exchanged via the Properties window (e.g. Knob Config Horizontal and Knob Config Vertical for the Linear Gauge [} 433]). A control developer can access these resources via the theme API. A "themed Resources" object contains the following properties: • name {String}: Name of the property to be changed. • display Name {String}: Name displayed in the Engineering theme editor. • description {String}: Optional description of the property that is displayed in the theme editor on mouseover. • type {string of a framework data type}: Data type of the property. The data type can be either a Twin CAT HMI data type or a user-specific data type defined under "data Types [} 1501]". Usually, user- specific data types are used (see Theming). 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.20 functions Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "functions": [ { "name": "custom Function", "display Name": "custom Function", "visible": true, "description": "This is a sample for a function that can be called.", "category": "Actions", "params": [], "type": null, "heritable": true, "search Terms": [] } ] This property defines functions of the control that are independent of attributes. The functions can optionally have parameter values or a return value. Each function must have the same name in Source.js, otherwise an error message appears in the browser console and the function is not executed. A JSON object for a function contains the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the function. • display Name {String}: Name of the function that is displayed in the Engineering. • description {String}: Description of the function that is displayed as a tooltip during mouseover in the engineering. 1498 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1499

Framework • category {String}: Category of the function under which the function is displayed in the Actions and Conditions Editor in the Engineering. • params [} 1499] {JSON object}, not required: Parameter values of the function. • type {string, Twin CAT HMI data type}: Return value of the function. The return value must have a Twin CAT HMI data type. • heritable {Boolean}: This property defines whether the function is to be passed on to derived classes. • search Terms {array of strings}, not required: This property defines search terms for the Engineering that are to optimize the search function within the Actions & Conditions Editor. This makes it possible to find the function using terms other than the function name. For example, if the strings "My Function" and "1234" are added to the array, the function can also be found under these terms. The following figure shows an example of two framework control functions in the Engineering, both of which have no return value and contain an optional parameter value function. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.20.1 params Type: JSON object Required: No "params": [ { "name": "function Parameter1", "display Name": "function Parameter1", "description": "This is a sample for a function parameter.", "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Number", "visible": true }, { "name": "function Parameter2", "display Name": "function Parameter2", "description": "This is a sample for a function parameter.", "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean", "bindable": false "visible": true } ] This property defines the optional parameters values of a function. The parameter values can be transferred via Engineering. A parameter object contains the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the parameter value. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1499
## Page 1500

Framework • display Name {String}: Name of the parameter value that is displayed in the Engineering. • description {String}: Description of the parameter value that is displayed as a tooltip during mouseover in the Engineering. • bindable {Boolean}: Determines whether a binding [} 109] can be set to this parameter. This is allowed by default. • visible {Boolean}: Visibility of the parameter value. The visibility determines whether the parameter is to be displayed or hidden in the Engineering. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.21 events Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "events": [ { "name": ".on My Custom Event", "display Name": ".on My Custom Event", "visible": true, "display Priority": 30, "category": "Control", "description": "This is a sample for a framework control event.", "heritable": true "allows Prevent Default": false } ] This property defines events that can be configured through the Engineering and are triggered in this framework control. An event is used to notify the Engineering that a specific event has occurred in the control. The HMI developer can respond to this event accordingly in the Engineering. Triggering of an event is implemented in Source.js. An event object contains the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the event. • display Name {String}: Name of the function that is displayed in the Engineering. • visible {Boolean}: Visibility of the event. If "visible" is set to "false", the event is not displayed in the Engineering. • display Priority {number}, not required: The priority determines the order in which the various events are displayed within the category. ◦ Values = 10 correspond to frequently used events such as ".on Pressed". ◦ Values = 15 correspond to standard events such as ".on Click" or "on Right Click". ◦ Values = 50 correspond to rarely used events such as ".on Mouse Up". ◦ No value assigned: The event is collapsed by default and has to be expanded using the arrow. • category {String}: The category determines under which category the event is listed in the Engineering. Existing categories such as "Operator" can be used, or new category names can be assigned. • description {String}: Optional description of the event, which is displayed as a tooltip on mouseover in the Engineering. • heritable {Boolean}: This property defines whether the event is to be passed on to derived classes. By default, this value is "true", so that the event is inherited. • allows Prevent Default {Boolean}, not required: This property specifies that a user can explicitly select prevent Default. See also Events [} 1515] The event configured above is displayed in the Engineering as follows: 1500 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.22 data Types Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "data Types": [ { "name": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Custom Datatype", "schema": "Schema/Type Definitions/Custom Datatype. Schema.json" } ] This property contains a list of all user-specific data types defined in the control. Developer can define their own data types in a JSON schema. The definition usually takes place under "Schema\Type Definitions [} 1485]". In order for the Engineering to know and be able to process the user-specific data types, they must be referenced in Description.json. A data Type object contains the following properties: • name {String}: Name of the new data type. Framework data types are always user-specific and have to start with "tchmi:framework#/definitions/{My Name}". For each data type an individual name must be assigned. • schema {string, relative path}: Relative path to the JSON schema file describing the data type. 14.2.1.1.4.1.2.23 access Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1501

Framework "access": [ { "name": "my Custom Right", "display Name": "my Custom Right", "description": "This is a sample for access rights in the framework control.", "visible": true, "default Value Internal": null } ] This property contains a list of user-specific access rights that can be configured via the Engineering. Access rights restrict user groups in their activities (see authorization system [} 970]). A user-specific access right must be evaluated in Source.js with corresponding user-specific logic [} 1516]. An access right object contains the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the access right. • display Name {String}: Name of the access right that is displayed in the Engineering. • description {String}: Description of the access right, which is displayed as a tooltip in the Engineering on mouseover. • visible {Boolean}: This property switches the visibility of the access right. If "visible" is set to "false", the access right is not displayed in the Engineering. • default Value Internal {Boolean}: This property defines the internal default value that is to apply if the access right is not configured via the Engineering. "true" means access is granted by default. "false" means access is not granted. If "zero" is set, the default value is not defined at this control. For a detailed description of the behavior of default Value Internal see authorization system [} 970]. Various user groups are assigned to an access right via the Engineering, which are structured according to the following schema: tchmi:framework#/definitions/Control Access Right This schema defines the type of access (Allow, Deny, Inherit) the respective user group has to the access right. In the Engineering, the access right is displayed in the Properties window as follows (for two different user groups): 1502 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.2 Template.html Like every control in the Twin CAT HMI, a framework control is based on HTML code. As soon as a framework control is instantiated in the Engineering of the Twin CAT HMI, an HTML div element is automatically created for the control. The developer of the framework control can define additional HTML code for the control within the control div element. HTML code The definition of the HTML code is implemented in the "Template.html" file. The use of this file is optional. The Template.html file is only used, if this is referenced in the Source.js of the Control [} 1508]. The Template.html file defines the base structure of a framework control. <div class="framework-control-js1-template tchmi-box"> <!--Place your code here--> </div> The HTML code defined within this file is automatically inserted in within the control div element (if the file is used) in the Engineering. The code can be viewed in the browser during debugging, for example. <div id="Tc Hmi Framework Control Js1" data-tchmi-type="framework-control-js1" data-tchmi-height="150" data-tchmi-height-unit="px" data-tchmi-left="137" data-tchmi-left-unit="px" data-tchmi-top="140" data-tchmi-top-unit="px" data-tchmi-value="True" data-tchmi-width="150" data-tchmi-width-unit="px" class="tchmi-box tchmi-control framework-control-js1" title="" style="left: 137px; top: 140px; width: 150px; height: 150px; z-index: 0; border-width: 0px;"> <div class="framework-control-js1-template tchmi-box"> <!--Place your code here--> </div> </div> Within the Template.html file any number of HTML elements can be defined. All standard HTML elements are available to the developer. In addition to the standard HTML elements, Twin CAT HMI controls can also be used in the Template.html file. The user-specific HTML code should be placed within the template div ("Place your code here"). Do not assign fixed IDs No fixed IDs may be assigned within the Template.html file. The assignment of IDs within the Template.html file would contradict the concept of multiple instantiation of a framework control, since an ID may only occur once within the HTML document. The outer control div element is automatically assigned a unique ID through the Engineering. CSS classes Within the elements in the Template.html file, CSS classes [} 1504] can be assigned, which are described via cascading style sheets files, either detached from the theme or depending on the theme. By default, the template class in the Style.css file is used at project level. Access via Java Script The HTML elements defined within the Template.html file can be further processed in the Source.js file [} 1507]. The elements can be changed during runtime or used as placeholders for dynamically created elements, for example. Processing of the HMTL elements in the Source.js file is optional. Static use within the Template.html file is also possible. If the HMTL elements are to be processed further in the Source.js file, references to the HTML elements must be created there. References to the Template.html file are created within the Prev Init function in the Source.js file. /** Handle template elements. Should be done before call to __previnit of super class. */ this.__element Template Root = this.get Element().find('.framework-control-js1-template'); The listing shows the access to the template div within Template.html. A search for the template div is initiated using the ".find()" JQuery function within the main JQuery object of the control. The reference to the JQuery object of the control can be reached via ".get Element()". If additional elements are placed within the template div, they can also be found using the ".find()" JQuery function. For performance reasons, we recommend to avoid using the outer JQuery object for the search in cases with many nested elements, but to use the inner elements that are already referenced instead. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1503

Framework Example: <div class="framework-control-js1-template tchmi-box"> <div class="framework-control-js1-inner-div"> <div class="framework-control-js1-inner-div-my-element"> </div> </div> </div> The following references result from this HMTL code: /** Handle template elements. Should be done before call to __previnit of super class. */ this.__element Template Root = this.get Element().find('.framework-control-js1-template'); this.__inner Div = this.__element Template Root.find('.framework-control-js1-inner-div'); this.__my Element = this.__inner Div.find('.framework-control-js1-inner-div-my-element'); 14.2.1.1.4.3 Style.css Within a framework control, the appearance of individual elements is described using cascading style sheets. The default design of the control is defined in the Style.css file at the project level and in the Style.css file, the base theme of the control. In addition to the standard design, further themes can be defined for the framework control. The appearance of a framework control can be changed at four different levels [} 1021] according to the theme system of the Twin CAT HMI. 14.2.1.1.4.3.1 Theme levels The appearance of a framework control can be described at different levels of the theme system [} 1021]. Level 4: Attribute definition per control type Control themes [} 1016] can be defined at level 4 of the theme system. Control themes allow individual attributes of the framework control to be overwritten. A control theme is defined within a theme file and can be created using the theme editor in Engineering or directly as JSON code. The theme file must be assigned to a specific theme within the project: The theme file must then be referenced as "Themed Values" under "themes [} 1491]" in the Description.json file. Level 5: Attribute definition by Default Value Internal At level 5 of the theme system, it is possible to set the properties of the attribute via Default Value Internal [} 1497]. Default Value Internal can be set in the Description.json file of the framework control. Example of a color attribute: "default Value Internal": { "color": "rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)" } Level 8: Cascading Style Sheets per theme 1504 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1505

Framework Cascading style sheet files can be added to a theme at level 8 of the theme system. Within the CSS file any element properties can be defined. The CSS file "Stylesheet" must then be referenced under "themes [} 1491]" in the Description.json file of the framework control. Level 9: Cascading Style Sheets on project level in the control At level 9 of the theme system, Cascading Style Sheet files can be added independently of a theme at project level in the control. By default, each framework control project contains a Style.css file at project level. Within this file, element properties are defined that are to apply independently of a theme (e.g. sizes of a div). All CSS files at the project level in the control must be referenced under dependency Files [} 1490] in the Description.json file of the framework control. 14.2.1.1.4.3.2 Using CSS classes The CSS class selectors are used within the cascading style sheet files of a framework control. Permitted selectors The following CSS selectors can be used conditionally within a CSS file of a framework control: • Type selectors • Attribute selectors • Class selectors With class selectors, new CSS classes are defined for a framework control, which means that CSS styles are not overwritten outside the framework control. If type or attribute selectors are to be used, you must ensure that they are only used for the class of the framework control and do not overwrite any styles outside the framework control (descendant selector): TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1505
## Page 1506

Framework .tchmi-framework-control-js2 a { color: red; } The following CSS selectors should not be used within a CSS file of a framework control: • ID selectors: Due to multiple instantiation, you cannot assign fixed IDs within a framework control. • Universal selector: A framework control should not overwrite any styles outside the control during instantiation. Using the class selectors CSS classes can be used in the Template.html file, or they can be added dynamically at runtime within the Source.js file. .tchmi-framework-control-js1-template { width: 100%; height: 100%; } Within the Template.html file, a CSS class is assigned via the HTML attribute "class": <div class="tchmi-framework-control-js1-template tchmi-box"> </div> The class "tchmi-box" sets CSS properties to facilitate element positioning and can be used with all positioned HTML elements. The dynamic use of a CSS class within Source.js can be realized via the j Query function ".add Class()", for example: this.__element Template Root.add Class('tchmi-framework-control-js1-my-custom-class'); 14.2.1.1.4.3.3 Overwriting CSS of controls Within the CSS files it is possible to overwrite the appearance of embedded Twin CAT HMI controls. For example, if you want to change the appearance of an embedded button within a control, you can do this by applying the CSS styles of the button. Please ensure that all buttons are not inadvertently assigned this appearance and that the CSS file of the general button does not overwrite that of the embedded control. Both can be achieved by so-called descendant selectors (spaces in CSS): .framework-control-js1 .tchmi-button { background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, #eff1f3, #aeb9c2); color: #4794da; box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); } .framework-control-js1 .tchmi-button.down { background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, #aeb9c2, #eff1f3); color: #000000; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); } All main elements of a control are assigned the control name as CSS class name (in this case framework- control-js1). If this is attached before the style of the control to be overwritten, the new appearance in the example only applies to buttons below the framework control. CSS selectors are always read from right to left: • First example: Main element of the button (".tchmi-button") if it is below (" ") Framework Control Js1 (".framework-control-js1"). • Second example: Element with class down (".down") if it is the main element of the button (".tchmi- button"), if it is below (" ") Framework Control Js1 (".framework-control-js1"). 1506 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.4 Source.js A framework control requires Java Script code. The Java Script code is defined in the Source.js file at project level, which is included in each framework control project. The Source.js file defines the base framework for the implementation of a framework control and can be flexibly extended. Programming conventions: The programming conventions provide a basis for standardizing framework controls. They are used to distinguish between internal and external access. • Member variables are marked with the prefix"__" and in Camel case: this.__my Var = …; • Functions with external access (Engineering: setter/getter functions) are identified without prefix and in Camel case: My Control.prototype.set My Var = … • Internal functions are marked with the prefix "__" and in Camel case: My Control.prototpye.__process My Var = … If you make changes in the Source.js file and the framework control is already associated with an HMI project, you must then carry out a project build [} 1487] of the framework control to apply the changes. 14.2.1.1.4.4.1 Control life cycle The control life cycle describes which system function of the control is called by the system at which time. In the control life cycle, a distinction is made as to whether the control is on an HMI page for which preloading is activated. The base control life cycle is described in the following diagram: Explanations: 1. The constructor is called during control instantiation. 2. The Prev Init function is called after the constructor and before the attribute setter functions are called. 3. The attribute setter functions are called after the Prev Init function. 4. The init function is called after the attribute setter functions. At this point, the control attributes are initialized by the attribute setter functions and have valid values. 5. The Attach function is called after the Init function, once the control has been added to the DOM on the HMI page. 6. The Detach function is called after a control has been removed from the DOM of the HMI page (e.g. during page switching). 7. The Destroy function is called after the control has been removed from the DOM of the HMI page, so that the system can destroy the controls. In addition, the Destroy function can be called explicitly at another point (for example, when subordinate controls elements are destroyed). HMI page: Preloading disabled Normally, preloading of an HMI page is disabled (Preload this partial: false), which means that the controls are not stored in the browser cache. This increases the speed of the initial HMI loading process, but it can lead to a reduction in the loading speed of individual HMI pages on which many controls are instantiated. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1507
## Page 1508

Framework In this case, the constructor of the control is called when the page is loaded (for example, when switching to the page or when loading the start page). This is followed by the Prev Init function, the attribute setter functions, the Init function and the Attach function. As soon as the page is unloaded (e.g. when switching to another page), the Detach function is called, followed by the Destroy function. The life cycle of the controls starts again when the HMI page is loaded. HMI page: Preloading enabled If preloading is enabled for an HMI page (preload this partial: true), the controls are stored in the browser cache. This increases the loading speed of a single HMI page, but it can lead to a reduction in the initial loading process of the HMI. In this case, the constructor of the control is called as soon as the HMI is initially loaded. This is followed by the Prev Init function, the attribute setter functions and the init function. The Attach function of the control is not called until the HMI page on which the control is instantiated is loaded. The Detach function is called as soon as the HMI page is unloaded. The Destroy function is not called automatically subsequently. The control remains in the browser cache. When the HMI page is reloaded, the Attach function is called directly. 14.2.1.1.4.4.2 Base framework The Source.js file already contains preconfigured source code that is required for various functions of the framework control and may not be modified in some cases. In Java Script, a framework control is a Java Script object that is described by various properties and methods. In other programming languages, the framework control would correspond to a class from which concrete instances (objects) are created at a later point in time.

In the event of invalid changes, the control can no longer be used properly. Do not change the base structure of the framework control within Source.js. There is a risk that the control can no longer be used. Definition of the namespaces Within Source.js, various namespaces are referenced and defined, which are required for the framework. Tc Hmi (function (Tc Hmi) { })(Tc Hmi); This function makes the control known within the "Tc Hmi" namespace. The framework cannot be accessed outside this namespace.

Framework (function (Controls) { })(Controls = Tc Hmi. Controls || (Tc Hmi. Controls = {})); This function makes the control known within the "Controls" namespace. This namespace contains all Twin CAT HMI controls (System [} 754], Beckhoff [} 124], Custom). The control is registered in the control namespace which is required for the Engineering of the Twin CAT HMI. The transfer of the Template [} 1503] parameter is optional. Controls.register('framework-control-js1', Custom. Framework Control Js1, 'Custom/ Framework Control Js1/', 'Custom/Framework Control Js1/Template.html'); Custom var Custom; (function (Custom) { })(Custom = Controls. Custom || (Controls. Custom = {})); This function defines the namespace for user-specific controls and makes the control known within the namespace. The concrete framework control object is defined in the custom namespace (prototypical control object) and then assigned to the custom namespace: Custom. Framework Control Js1 = Framework Control Js1; Prototypical control object A framework control is defined by a Java Script object within the custom namespace. The logic is implemented in this section (Constructor [} 1510], System functions [} 1511], Attributes [} 1512], Functions [} 1514], Events [} 1515], Access rights [} 1516]). var Framework Control Js1 = (function (_super) { __extends(Framework Control Js1, _super); /** Control specific logic */ return Framework Control Js1; })(Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control); The object (_super) of the base control [} 1489] defined in Description.json [} 1486] (usually Tc Hmi Control [} 754] ) is passed to the framework control. The framework control inherits all properties of the defined base control. The framework control is defined by a function, in which the user-specific code of the framework control is implemented. A function in Java Script always links a prototypical object. Access to the prototypical object of this function is indicated by the property "protoype". All properties (other functions) of the framework control are stored in the function object via the prototype. My Control Name.prototype.my Property = function () {...}; When a specific instance (Java Script object) is created by the function, the instance has all the properties of the prototypical object of the function. 14.2.1.1.4.4.3 Constructor Each framework control contains a constructor that is structured as follows: function Framework Control Js1(element, pc Element, attrs) { /** Call base constructor */ _super.call(this, element, pc Element, attrs); /** Attribute variables are initialized with undefined. The System will call the setter later. See "Attribute philosophy" above. */ this.__value = undefined; } Within the constructor, the internal variables of the control (member variables) are initialized with "undefined". Initialization at this point is not necessary, but is recommended for better clarity. The parameter values of the constructor are only used internally and forwarded to the base constructor call. 1510 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.4.4 System functions Framework controls have functions that are called by the system at different times. Each system function calls the respective system function of the basic class (Tc Hmi Control [} 754]) via the "_super" object and passes a reference to the current control object. Prev Init function Framework Control Js1.prototype.__previnit = function () { /** Handle template elements. Should be done before call to __previnit of super class. */ this.__element Template Root = this.get Element().find('.framework-control-js1-template'); /** Call __previnit of super class. */ _super.prototype.__previnit.call(this); }; The Prev Init function is automatically called after the system calls the constructor [} 1510] and before the attribute setters of each attribute are called. Accordingly, the member variables of the attributes have the value "undefined" when the Prev Init function is called. Within the Prev Init function, the references [} 1503] to the HMTL elements are created from the Template.html file. This function may only be called by the system and not explicitly by the developer. Init function Framework Control Js1.prototype.__init = function () { _super.prototype.__init.call(this); }; The Init function is called automatically by the system after the attribute setters of the individual attributes have been called. Accordingly, when the Init function is called, the member variables of the attributes already have the values that were passed to the control or defined internally as default values. This function may only be called by the system and not explicitly by the developer. Attach function Framework Control Js1.prototype.__attach = function () { /** * Enable everything which was disabled while __detach function was called! */ /** * Initialize everything which is only available while the control is part of the active dom. */ /** Call base __attach function */ _super.prototype.__attach.call(this); }; The Attach function is automatically called by the system after the current control instance has been added to the DOM of the HTML document. Within the Attach function, all calculations should be performed that are only available while the control instance is in the DOM (e.g. .get Bounding Client Rect() of DOM elements or .width() of j Query elements). The opposite of the Attach function is the Detach function. This function may only be called by the system and not explicitly by the developer. Detach function Framework Control Js1.prototype.__detach = function () { /** * Disable everything which is not needed while the control is not part of the active dom. * No need to listen to events for example! */ TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1511
## Page 1512

Framework /** Call base __detach function */ _super.prototype.__detach.call(this); }; The system automatically calls the Detach function after the current control instance has been removed from the DOM of the HTML document. In the Detach function, all functions that are no longer required after the control instance has been removed from the DOM are to be disabled. The opposite of the Detach function is the Attach function. This function may only be called by the system and not explicitly by the developer. Destroy function Framework Control Js1.prototype.destroy = function () { /** * Free resources */ /** Call base __destroy function */ _super.prototype.destroy.call(this); }; The system automatically calls the Destroy function when the control instance is no longer used (after the Detach function). If the control is on an HTML page where "Preload Partial" is enabled, the Destroy function is not called because the page is still saved in the browser cache. Within the Destroy function, the elements that were created during runtime are to be destroyed. This function can also be called explicitly (for example when child controls are destroyed). 14.2.1.1.4.4.5 Attributes Framework control attributes [} 1492] defined in Description.json must be initialized within Source.js, and the corresponding setter, getter and process methods must be implemented. The setter and getter methods provide central access to the attribute. The following examples refer to the following attribute, which is defined in Description.json under "attributes [} 1492]": "attributes": [ { "name": "data-tchmi-value", "property Name": "Value", "property Setter Name": "set Value", "property Getter Name": "get Value", "display Name": "Value", "visible": true, "themeable": "Standard", "display Priority": 10, "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean", "category": "Value", "description": "", "read Only": false, "bindable": true, "heritable": true, "default Value": false, "default Value Internal": false } ] Initialization The attributes are initialized in the constructor of the framework control. Initialization is not required here (variables without keywords are automatically initialized in Java Script when used), but is recommended for better clarity. this.__value = undefined; 1512 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1513

Framework Member variables and functions that cannot be accessed from outside are prefixed with "__". Setter method The setter method of an attribute is only required for attributes that are not set to "read Only [} 1496]" (all attributes that can be set via Engineering). Like the definition, the setter method must be named in the "property Setter Name [} 1493]". /** * @description Setter function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. * @param {Boolean} value New the new value or null * @returns {void} */ Framework Control Js1.prototype.set Value = function (value New) { // convert the value with the value converter var converted Value = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Boolean(value New); // check if the converted value is valid if (converted Value === null) { // if we have no value to set we have to fall back to the default Value Internal from description.json converted Value = this.get Attribute Default Value Internal('Value'); } if (tchmi_equal(converted Value, this.__value)) { // skip processing when the value has not changed return; } // remember the new value this.__value = converted Value; // inform the system that the function has a changed result. Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + ".on Function Result Changed", ["get Value"]); // call process function to process the new value this.__process Value(); }; Within the setter method, the parameter that was passed is first converted into the expected data type by Engineering using the framework API function "Value Converter". If an invalid value is passed to the Value Converter or if the conversion of the value fails, the function returns "null". In this case the Default Value Internal [} 1497] from Description.json is used. The system then checks whether a value change to the last stored value of the attribute on the member variable has taken place. If no value change has taken place, the setter is exited. If a value change has taken place, the value of the member variable for the attribute is overwritten and the system is notified that a value change has taken place. Finally, the Process method is called for the value in which the response to the value change takes place. The function "tchmi_equal" should be used to check for a change in value. The JS comparison operator "===" can only check the base Java Script data types but not complex JSON objects. Getter method The getter method of an attribute returns the current value of the attribute and is required for each attribute. Like the definition, the getter method must be named in the "property Getter Name [} 1493]". /** * @description Getter function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. * @returns {Boolean} */ Framework Control Js1.prototype.get Value = function () { return this.__value; }; TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1513
## Page 1514

Framework Process-Methode The Process method is always called when the attribute value has been changed. The response to the value changes is to be implemented in the process method. For example, depending on a Boolean value elements can be switched visible or invisible, or a list can be created dynamically based on a transferred JSON object. /** * @description Processor function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. * @returns {void} */ Framework Control Js1.prototype.__process Value = function () { // process actions with Value // ... }; 14.2.1.1.4.4.6 Functions Framework control functions [} 1498] defined in Description.json must be defined and implemented in Source.js. The function must be named like the "name [} 1498]" of the function in Description.json. Function without parameter values A function without parameter values is defined in Description.json as follows: "functions": [ { "name": "custom Function", "display Name": "custom Function", "visible": true, "description": "This is a sample for a function that can be called.", "category": "Actions", "params": [], "type": null, "heritable": true, "search Terms": [] } ] This results in the following code for Source.js: /** * @description This is the call of the api function 'custom Function'. * @returns {void} */ Framework Control Js1.prototype.custom Function = function () { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the engineering in Visual Studio */ // implement function logic here }; Within the function, any execution logic of the function can be implemented. Function with return value The functions enables a return value to be returned the calling point in Engineering. The return value is defined in Description.json under "type". "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean" Within the function in Source.js it is then possible to return a value of the corresponding type. /** * @description This is the call of the api function 'custom Function'. * @returns {Boolean} */ Framework Control Js1.prototype.custom Function = function () { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the engineering in Visual Studio */ 1514 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1515

Framework // implement function logic here return true; }; Function with parameter values A function with parameter values [} 1499] is defined in Description.json as follows: "functions": [ { "name": "custom Function", "display Name": " custom Function ", "visible": true, "description": "This is a sample for a function that can be called by the engineering.", "category": "Actions", "params": [ { "name": "function Parameter1", "display Name": "function Parameter1", "description": "This is a sample for a function parameter.", "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Number", "visible": true }, { "name": "function Parameter2", "display Name": "function Parameter2", "description": "This is a sample for a function parameter.", "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean", "visible": true } ], "type": null, "heritable": false, "searchterms": [] } ] The function is implemented in Source.js like a normal function. The parameter values are passed with the function call. The parameters must be checked for validity before they are used, similar to the attribute setters [} 1512]. /** * @description This is the call of the api function 'custom Function'. * @returns {void} */ Framework Control Js1.prototype.custom Function = function (function Parameter1, function Parameter2) { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the enginnering in the twincat */ var converted Parameter1 = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Number(function Parameter1); if (converted Parameter1 === null) { // parameter is null: define what to do in this case // exit function call if the execution without this parameter is not possible return; } var converted Parameter2 = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Boolean(function Parameter2); if (converted Parameter2 === null) { // parameter is null: define what to do in this case // exit function call if the execution without this parameter is not possible return; } // implement function logic with the evaluation of the parameters here }; 14.2.1.1.4.4.7 Events Framework control events defined in Description.json should be triggered in Source.js. The name of the event must be named like the "name [} 1500]" of the event in Description.json. An event can be triggered in different situations, e.g. when a certain record changes (see ".on Data Changed [} 251]" in the data grid [} 219]). TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1515
## Page 1516

Framework An event is triggered in Source.js via the Event Provider of the framework. The framework API function "Event Provider.raise()" is used for this purpose. When the event is triggered, the concrete control instance must be identified with "this.__id". // raise .on My Custom Event event Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + '.on My Custom Event); Optionally, parameters can be passed to the event callbacks when the event is triggered. // declare parameter: type anything var my Parameter Object = 42; // raise .on My Custom Event event with event parameters Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + '.on My Custom Event, my Parameter Object); The response to the triggered events can take place in Engineering via the Properties window [} 61] or via the registration of the event in a Code Behind file [} 1480]. If allow Prevent Default is allowed in the event definition [} 1500], the my Parameter Object should offer prevent Default as a function. All DOM and j Query event objects meet this requirement, for example. This function is called if the user has set the option for this event in Engineering. 14.2.1.1.4.4.8 Access rights User-specific access rights [} 1501] defined in Description.json and configured in Engineering [} 61] should be checked and evaluated in Source.js. Depending on the user-specific access rights [} 964], specific elements can be switched visible or invisible or enabled or disabled, for example. The evaluation of the configured access rights is performed via the framework API function "Tc Hmi. Access.check Access()". The current instance of the control is passed to the function (this) and the name of the right to be checked, which must correspond to the definition in Description.json. // check user access of "my Custom Right" that is defined in the description.json if (Tc Hmi. Access.check Access(this, 'my Custom Right') === true) { // current user has the rights to do this // process actions with the right // show elements, enable buttons, etc. } else { // Current user has no rights to do this // process actions without the rights // hide elements, disable buttons, etc. } Since user management only works when authentication is active, the configured functions are not available in live view. 14.2.1.1.4.5 Custom Datatype. Schema.json Within a framework control project, user-specific and complex data types can be implemented if the data type is not covered by a standard data type. In principle, any data structures can be transferred as objects without the need for a user-specific data type. A user-specific data type is required if an editor is to be provided for generating the data in Engineering. The data editor is generically based on a given JSON schema. The following user-specific data types can be implemented: • Objects [} 1520] with fixed properties • Array [} 1522] of any data types • Enumerations [} 1524] • Limitation [} 1525] of several allowed data types 1516 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1517

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.5.1 Creating a custom data type Add a new item in the "Type Definitions" folder under "Schema". Add a new JSON file or JSON schema file to the project. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1517
## Page 1518

Framework Reference the schema file in Description.json under "data Types [} 1501]". Note that user-specific data types are assigned to the "Framework" category. "data Types": [ { "name": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Custom Datatype", "schema": "Schema/Type Definitions/Custom Datatype. Schema.json" } ] You can then use the user-specific data type within Description.json. "type": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Custom Datatype If the framework control is already referenced in an HMI project, a project build (see First Steps [} 1482]) must then be executed and the HMI project reloaded so that the new data type is included in the type descriptions of the HMI project. To reload the project, right-click on the HMI project and select "Unload project". 1518 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1519

Framework Then select "Reload project" to reload the project. You can then use all the functions as usual. 14.2.1.1.4.5.2 Implementing a custom data type The configuration of a JSON schema for the framework follows a certain structure. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "{Datatype Name}": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": " {Datatype Name} ", "type": "array", //... } } } Each JSON schema contains a definition that describes the data type ({Datatatype Name}). The definition of the data type contains the specification (type) and the description of the data type through attributes depending on the respective data type. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1519
## Page 1520

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.5.2.1 Objects Objects can contain any properties. A property is described under Properties and can be refined through optional metadata (properties Meta). The following JSON schema describes an object with two properties. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "Custom Datatype": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "Custom Datatype", "type": "object", "properties Meta": [ { "name": "axis Name", "category": "Name", "display Name": "Axis Name", "display Priority": 10, "description": "", "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": null }, { "name": "axis Color", "category": "Colors", "display Name": "Axis color", "display Priority": 10, "description": "", "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": { "color": "#4794da" } } ], "properties": { "axis Name": { "type": "string" }, "axis Color": { "$ref": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Solid Color" } }, "required": [ "axis Name" ] } } } This results in the following generic data editor in Engineering. 1520 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1521

Framework Explanations properties Meta: The metadata of the properties are optional. They describe the display within the generic data editor. The metadata are described by the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the property, see "name [} 1492]" in Description.json. Info: The name must match the name under the properties. • category {String}: Name of the category under which the property is displayed in the generic data editor, see "category [} 1495]" in Description.json. • display Name {String}: Name of the property displayed in the generic data editor, see "display Name [} 1493]" in Description.json. • display Priority {Number}: Priority of the display, see "display Priority [} 1495]" in Description.json. • description {String}: Description of the property, see "description [} 1496]" in Description.json. • default Value: Default value used initially in engineering, see "default Value [} 1497]" in Description.json. • default Value Internal: Internal default value, see "default Value Internal [} 1497]" in Description.json. properties: The name and data type of the object properties are described under Properties. The name is determined by the name of the property. The data type can be described as follows: • type {String}: Default JSON data type of the property, or • $ref {String, reference}: Reference to a framework data type. This can be implemented within the project or taken from the existing data type descriptions of the framework. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1521
## Page 1522

Framework required: The required properties are listed under "required". The list is based on the internal name. If a property of the object that is set to required is not set in Engineering, the generic data editor displays a warning. 14.2.1.1.4.5.2.2 Arrays Arrays can be created from simple data types and complex objects. Array of simple data types Simple data types are specified within the "items" property under the "type" data type property. The following schema defines an array of strings. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "Custom Datatype": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "Custom Datatype", "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } } } This schema generates the following generic data editor in Engineering. The generic data editor displays the array elements on the rleft-hand side under the name of the respective data type (in the example: string). If a self-defined name is to be displayed instead, an object with a property of the type of the data type must be selected instead of the simple data type, and the "display Name" of the property must be set in the metadata. Array of complex data types Complex data types are specified in the property "items" under the reference property "$ref". The following schema defines an array of objects of data type "Custom Datatype". This data type was previously implemented as Object [} 1520]. 1522 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1523

Framework { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "My Array": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "My Array", "type": "array", "items": { "$ref": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Custom Datatype" } } } } Furthermore, it is possible to describe the object directly within the array definition. The following schema describes the same array with the definition of the object within the property "items". { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "My Array Inline Object": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "My Array Inline Object", "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "title": "Custom Object", "description": "Defines a custom object in the array.", "properties Meta": [ { "name": "axis Name", "category": "Name", "display Name": "Axis Name", "display Priority": 10, "description": "", "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": null }, { "name": "axis Color", "category": "Colors", "display Name": "Axis color", "display Priority": 10, "description": "", "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": { "color": "#4794da" } } ], "properties": { "axis Name": { "type": "string" }, "axis Color": { "$ref": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Solid Color" } }, "required": [ "axis Name" ] } } } } Both schema files generate the following generic data editor in Engineering. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1523
## Page 1524

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.5.2.3 Enumerations Enumerations can contain any elements for the data type string. In the Engineering, enumerations are not displayed in the generic data editor, but in the combo box in the Properties window. The permissible values of the enumeration are defined in the property "enum" in an array. The following schema defines an exemplary enumeration. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "My Enum": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "My Enum", "type": "string", "enum": [ "My Value1", "My Value2", "My Value3", "My Value4" ] } } } This results in the following display in Engineering. 1524 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1525

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.5.2.4 Restrict permitted data types User-specific data types can be restricted so that only certain data types can be transferred. As a result, when creating a binding [} 109] only the symbols corresponding to the permitted data types are displayed. The following schema defines an exemplary restriction of permissible values (one Of). Only values that have the data type "Time" or "Time Span" are permitted. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "My Constrained Datatype": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "one Of": [ { "title": "Time", "$ref": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Date Time" }, { "title": "Timespan", "$ref": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Time Span" } ] } } } The display in Engineering is normally an attribute. However, only bindings to symbols that correspond to the permitted data types can be created. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1525
## Page 1526

Framework 14.2.1.1.4.6 Manifest.json The Manifest.json file contains optional information that can be set to create a Twin CAT HMI package. The information is placed under the metadata and generated automatically when the project is created. "metadata": { "industrial Field": "", "package Type": "Framework Ext Prj", "id": "Framework Control Js1", "version": "1.0.0.0", "guid": "7001c40b-7081-4c53-8496-f416efe212b9", "configuration Name": "", "platform Name": "", "creation Time": 1520610054, "authors": "", "owners": "", "summary": "", "license Url": "", "project Url": "", "icon Url": "", "require License Acceptance": false, "description": "", "release Notes": "", "copyright": "", "tags": "", "dependencies": [], "references": [] } For creating a package, the version number must match the version number [} 1488] in Description.json [} 1486]. 14.2.2 current version Note that there may be small differences in behavior between different versions. Differences between version 1.10 and version 1.12 From version 1.12, multiple control classes can exist with the same type name. An additional namespace has been added to differentiate between them. For example, the control types Tc Hmi. Controls. Base Template. Tc Hmi Breadcrumb and Tc Hmi. Controls. Responsive Navigation. Tc Hmi Breadcrumb are supplied. All APIs that expect a control type as input (such as Tc Hmi. Control Factory.create Ex) can be called with the old or new form. However, the API get Type of all controls had to be changed. In version 1.8 and 1.10 a standard button returned tchmi-button as result whereas from version 1.12 on the full qualified name Tc Hmi. Controls. Beckhoff. Tc Hmi Button is returned. If you check for the type in your own source code, you may have to adapt it to the new format. 14.2.2.1 Framework project A framework project can combine different contents [} 1534] such as controls, functions, Java Script libraries, CSS files or even images to form a package. This can be used as Nu Get package [} 1527] (once or multiple times) or passed on. Available from version 1.12.742.0 1526 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1527

Framework 14.2.2.1.1 Introduction An HMI project can be extended with User Controls, functions and Code-Behind. However, resources defined there can only be used in one project. The framework project offers a supplement in which many different components [} 1534] are encapsulated together. These can be full controls, functions, CSS files or Java Script libraries. This content can still simply be passed on. See Integrating a project [} 1527]. 14.2.2.1.2 Build Project Open Visual Studio and click Add new project. Twin CAT HMI offers two different project templates for framework projects. The "Twin CAT HMI Framework Project" contains a control [} 1535], whereas the "Twin CAT HMI Framework Project Empty" does not. In both projects, any number of control, functions [} 1583] or other components [} 1534] can be stored and adapted to your requirements. The project can then be integrated [} 1527] directly as a reference or as a Nu Get package in a Twin CAT HMI project. 14.2.2.1.3 Integrating a project The content of a framework project can be referenced in an HMI project in the same Visual Studio solution or exported as a Nu Get package. As a package it can be imported several times into different projects and thus reused. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1527
## Page 1528

Framework Integration via reference For integration via a reference select "Add Reference...". This opens a dialog in which all framework projects within the same solution are listed: If the project was selected with the checkbox, it is shown under References in the HMI project: When the framework project is built, the HMI project recognizes this and updates the controls and other files from the referenced project. Integration via Nu Get package Before the current content can be integrated, it must be created as a Nu Get package. This can easily be done via the menu item "Create Nu Get Package ...": 1528 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1529

Framework The package is created in the directory C:\Twin CAT\Functions\TE2000-HMI- Engineering\References. In Visual Studio this directory is known as "Twin CAT HMI Customer“. The file name is generated from the package name and its version number. Both can be set in the nuspec file [} 1531]. To integrate the created file into an HMI project, select "Manage Nu Get Packages ...": Here, "Twin CAT HMI Customer" is selected on the right-hand side of the Nu Get Package Manager, and the new package can be seen in the "Browse" tab. If the package was selected with "Install", it is shown under References in the HMI project: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1529
## Page 1530

Framework Passing on Nu Get packages Since the package forms a closed unit, it can also be passed on as a file. Different options are available. • Direct file transfer: To this end the file must be copied to the directory C: \Twin CAT\Functions\TE2000-HMI-Engineering\References on the target computer. It is then available for selection in the Nu Get Package Manager. • A shared directory: In applications where packages are exchanged on a regular basis, additional directories can be defined as package sources. The setting for this can be found in the Visual Studio options under Nu Get Package Manager/Package Sources: • Furthermore it is possible to make the packages available in the public Nu Get gallery at nuget.org. 14.2.2.1.4 Structure All framework projects need certain files. These are available by default for a new project: 1530 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1531

Framework • The folder Images [} 1531] initially contains only a logo, which is used in the Nu Get package. • The .nuspec file [} 1531] contains metadata for creating a Nu Get package. See also the notes in the chapter on Integrating a project [} 1527] • Manifest.json [} 1532] contains a list of resources stored in the framework project. • packages.config [} 1533] contains information on which Nu Get packages the framework project itself references. • The file tsconfig.tpl.json [} 1533] configures the Type Script compiler. Furthermore, any number of controls [} 1534] are possible. These must each be created in a separate folder. Functions [} 1583], Java Script [} 1534] and CSS files [} 1534] on the other hand can be created without subfolders and simply have to be referenced accordingly in the Manifest.json file. 14.2.2.1.4.1 References A framework project can use content from other Nu Get packages. If, for example, an Tc Hmi Button [} 176] is to be created in a control factory, the Nu Get package Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Controls must be integrated (and the control must be added to tsconfig.tpl.json [} 1533]). Select Manage Nu Get Packages from the context menu in the References node. Select the required package in the Browse tab. It may be necessary to adapt the source in the Package source drop-down box. Twin CAT HMI Official contains a list of all packages that are provided with the Twin CAT HMI setup. Twin CAT HMI Customer contains all packages that were created on this computer. 14.2.2.1.4.2 Images This directory contains the logo of the Nu Get package. However, a package can also contain images for the gallery of the HMI project. This option is described for the components under Images [} 1534]. 14.2.2.1.4.3 Project.nuspec This file contains metadata for creating a Nu Get package. Note the following important entries: • id: Denotes the full name of the package. The name must be unique in the respective repository (on the computer or at nuget.org, if required). Namespace-like names can be separated with a dot. To avoid conflicts, the company name can be used as the first part, for example. See example Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. PDFViewer • version: Nu Get supports version numbers with three components (e.g. 1.2.1). Furthermore, a name suffix is common for pre-release versions (1.2.1-beta). If an HMI project is opened and a higher version number is found, you will be notified of the update option. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1531

Framework • dependencies: This is where package dependencies are defined. At least Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Framework should have an entry here. See also References [} 1531]. • files: This entry determines which files should be included in the package. Here you can specify single files or multiple files. See also the official documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec 14.2.2.1.4.4 Manifest.json This file is the main file of each framework project or package. All components and their dependencies are documented here. Possible components are: • Package: This entry references a specific Nu Get package as a dependency by its name in nuget Id. If, for example, a Tc Hmi Button (from Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Controls) is used in its own package, Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Framework does not have to be referenced additionally, since this is already done in the controls package. • Function: This registers a function [} 1583] from this package in the system. The function directory (base Path) is specified for this. The name of the function description file is specified as description File. • Resource: Two resource types can be included, Java Script [} 1534] files and CSS [} 1534] files. The embedding process is carried out in the correct order. A CSS resource, which is located between two controls in the manifest file, is therefore also included between the CSS files of these two controls. For CSS files, a theme name can also be specified (since version 1.12.752.0). In this case, the file will only be included if a theme with the corresponding name is active, similar to what is possible with control CSS files [} 1540]. • Control: This registers a control [} 1534] from this package in the system. The control directory (base Path) is specified for this. The name of the control description file, Description.json, should not be changed. Furthermore, you can use the entry toolbox Category to define where a control appears in the Visual Studio toolbar. • Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI:200 is stored in the System category. • Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI:201 is stored in the Beckhoff category. • Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI:202 is stored in the 3rd party category. • Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI:203 is stored in the Legacy (1.10) category. • You can create your own entries via provide Metadata (also for multiple languages in Visual Studio). See example below. • If no category is defined here, the name of the project itself is used as the category. Sample { "api Version": 1, "modules": [ { "type": "Package", "nuget Id": "Beckhoff.

Schema.json" } 14.2.2.1.4.5 packages.config This file contains information on which Nu Get packages the framework project itself references. The version number range with which the packages must comply is also specified here. See also the official documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/packages-config 14.2.2.1.4.6 tsconfig.tpl.json All options of the Type Script compiler are set in tsconfig.json. This checks whether API calls are used correctly, for example. Type definitions for j Query, the framework and the controls are required to analyze the source code. These are provided with the Nu Get packages. Since these paths are not always in the same place, the user only edits this template file. Visual Studio uses this to create the correct tsconfig.json. compiler Options The default is a standard set of options in the section compiler Options. These can be changed. However, it is possible that subsequently a project can no longer be built or no longer works in all browsers. See the official documentation: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html include Type definitions for APIs that do not come from the browser itself are integrated in the section include. The entry "$(Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Framework). Install Path/Tc Hmi.d.ts" TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1533
## Page 1534

Framework that references j Query, framework and the system controls is essential. If, for example, an Tc Hmi Button [} 176] is to be created in a control factory, the Nu Get package Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Controls must be integrated and this line must be added: "$(Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Controls). Install Path/Tc Hmi Button/Tc Hmi Button.d.ts" files Under Files, all Type Script files to be compiled by the Type Script compiler must be included individually and in the correct order. New files for functions or controls are automatically added here, but manual intervention may also be necessary. The Type Script compiler then creates Java Script files with the same base name and the extension .js instead of .ts. This should be entered under Controls [} 1535] in description.json [} 1539], for example. 14.2.2.1.5 Components A framework project/package may include a number of components. Most of these components require a reference in Manifest.json [} 1532]. Furthermore, a framework package can provide additions to the image gallery. 14.2.2.1.5.1 Controls Creating your own controls is probably the most common use case for a framework project. This is described in detail in a special section of the documentation [} 1535]. 14.2.2.1.5.2 Functions The HMI can be flexibly extended with HMI functions. These can also be created in a framework project. This is described in detail in a special section of the documentation [} 1583]. 14.2.2.1.5.3 Stylesheets A framework project can contain any number of stylesheet files (which may be independent of controls). This is useful for common styles of controls within a project, for example. Any file that has its own entry in the Manifest.json [} 1532] file is integrated in the browser accordingly. The embedding process is carried out in the correct order. A CSS file, which is located between two controls [} 1535] in the manifest file, is therefore also included between the CSS files of these two controls. 14.2.2.1.5.4 JS libraries / Code-Behind A framework project can contain any number of Java Script files (which may be independent of controls or functions). This is useful for external libraries, for example. Any file that has a separate entry in the Manifest.json [} 1532] file is available in the browser (and therefore to all controls). 14.2.2.1.5.5 Images A Nu Get package may include images that appear directly in the Gallery Explorer [} 958]. To do this, the files in the Nu Get package must be stored in the special folder {gallery} folder. They should be stored in the Image Library directory and then referenced in the nuspec file [} 1531]: <file src="Image Library\*" target="tools\native1.12-tchmi\{gallery}\"/> 1534 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.2.2 Controls Starting with version 1.12, controls are always created in a framework project. The framework project can store several controls in encapsulated form. Other options include functions and further resources. See Framework project [} 1526] 14.2.2.2.1 Introduction Framework controls are user-specific controls that are not created with the graphical WYSIWYG editor [} 37]. Framework controls are used if the desired behavior cannot be mapped with the standard controls or a user control. Unlike a Code Behind file [} 1478], a framework control can be used independently of the HMI project, so that the source code can be reused. Each control must have a reference in Manifest.json [} 1532] within a framework package in order to be able to use it. Technology Framework controls are developed using web development tools. • HTML: Type and structure of the elements of the framework control • CSS: Design of the elements of the framework control • Type Script/Java Script: Logic behind the elements of the framework control Developers are no longer bound to the Twin CAT HMI controls and can use all the elements and functionalities they are already familiar with from web development within a framework control. The standard Twin CAT HMI controls are implemented on the same basis as a framework control. It is also possible to reuse the Twin CAT HMI controls in the framework control or to add user-specific properties. Application scenarios Framework controls can map customer-specific and application-specific requirements. The following use cases can be implemented with a framework control: • Mapping of complex Type Script/Java Script logic • Reusing HTML, JS and CSS in a control • Dynamic elements: Adding and removing HTML elements and controls at runtime • Developing responsive controls • Realizing and integrating 3D models Use The framework controls form part of a framework project and can be integrated directly as references [} 1527] in a Twin CAT HMI project if both projects are in the same Solution. Furthermore, it is possible to export the framework project as a Nu Get package [} 1527] and install it in different HMI projects. In this way, it is possible to implement application-specific control libraries. Within the HMI project, a framework control is used like a standard Twin CAT HMI control. 14.2.2.2.2 Creating a control A framework project can contain any number of controls. Each control is stored in its own folder, along with all associated files. A control can be created based on Type Script or Java Script. Both have the same technical options and are very similar in terms of programming. Due to the better programming support offered by Visual Studio, Type Script should be selected for new controls. To create a new control, right-click on the destination folder in the context menu and select Add new Item. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1535
## Page 1536

Framework A new folder is then created with the chosen name. This folder contains all the important files of a control. The control is still automatically entered in the Manifest.json [} 1532] file. It then becomes part of the project and can be used as a project reference or Nu Get package, for example. See Integrating a project [} 1527]. 14.2.2.2.3 Structure A framework control consists of a series of files. Most of these files are created automatically when a control is created and filled with a base structure. Each usable control of a framework project must be referenced in Manifest.json [} 1532]. This section is intended to serve as a reference for these file contents. 14.2.2.2.3.1 Description.json This section describes the structure of the description file Description.json. Any changes in Description.json must be followed by a project build (see Build Project [} 1527]). 14.2.2.2.3.1.1 Introduction Twin CAT HMI Engineering reads all properties of the control from the Description.json file. The properties allow you to transfer data to the control and vice versa. In Twin CAT HMI Engineering, the control can be configured via the Properties window [} 61] or via the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62]. The developer can define additional attributes, besides the standard attributes of each framework control. In many cases the following user-specific properties are defined in Description.json: • Attributes [} 1541] (data interfaces) • Functions [} 1548] • Events [} 1549] • Access rights [} 1551] • User-specific data types [} 1551] 1536 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.1.2 Properties Type: Specifies the data type of the property. Required: Specifies whether the property is required for the framework control (yes) or is optional (no). 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.1 $schema Type: String (relative path) Required: No "$schema": "../.hmiframework/Schema/Control Description. Schema.json" This property references the JSON schema that describes the structure of Description.json. The schema is in a special folder of the framework control project. It is provided and updated by the Nu Get package Beckhoff. Twin CAT. HMI. Framework. Including the JSON schema enables Intellisense in Visual Studio for each property. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.2 name Type: String Required: Yes "name": "Framework Prj1Control" This property is the name of the framework control, which is automatically generated. The name (extended by the namespace [} 1537]) is added to the control as CSS class and can be used within the CSS files [} 1554] in the framework control project to describe the styles. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.3 namespace Type: String Required: Yes "name": "Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj1" This property is the namespace of the framework control, which is automatically generated based on the project name. The name (extended by the name [} 1537]) is added to the control as CSS class and can be used within the CSS files [} 1554] in the framework control project to describe the styles. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.4 display Name Type: String Required: Yes "display Name": "Framework Control Js1" This property is the name of the control that is displayed as the control name in the Engineering. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.5 version Type: JSON object Required: Yes "version": { "full": "1.0.0.0", "major": 1, "minor": 0, "revision": 0, "build": 0 } This property is the version number of the framework control that is used for versioning a framework control. The version number is subdivided into the major release number, minor release number, revision number and build number. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1537
## Page 1538

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.6 visible Type: Boolean Required: Yes "visible": true This property makes the control visible or hides it in the toolbox in the Engineering. By default, a control is always displayed in the toolbox. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.7 themeable Type: Enum string Required: No "themeable": "Standard" This property determines whether the control is displayed in the theme editor [} 1012] within in the Twin CAT HMI Engineering. Permissible values: • Standard: The control is displayed in the theme editor. • None: The control is not displayed in the theme editor. • Advanced: The control is only displayed in the theme editor if the "Advanced" property is enabled in the theme editor. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.8 base Type: String Required: Yes "base": "Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control" This property determines whether the control inherits the properties of another control. By default, a framework control inherits all properties of Description.json of the base control Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control, which defines a base framework for all Twin CAT HMI controls. The control can be made to inherit from other controls, such as a button, if a particular control is to be extended. The control name that must be specified here corresponds to the control type [} 1537] including its namespace [} 1537], which are defined in Description.json. Validity This property must refer to a valid control and must not have the value null, otherwise the control can no longer be used in the Engineering. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.9 template Type: String Required: No "base": "Template.html" This property defines whether the system should automatically create an HTML subtree for the control. For further details please refer to the description of the template file [} 1552]. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.10 description Type: String Required: Yes "description": "This description text will be used as a Tooltip in Visual Studio." This property is the description of the control and is displayed as a tooltip when the mouse is moved over the control in the toolbox. 1538 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.11 default Designer Event Type: String Required: No "default Designer Event": "" This property determines which event is to be configured when the control is double-clicked in the Actions and Conditions Editor [} 62]. By default (no entry or empty entry), no editor is opened on double-clicking. All standard and custom events defined in Description.json can be used here. The following listing shows an example of a custom event: "default Designer Event": ".on My Custom Event" Custom events are defined under events [} 1549]. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.12 properties Type: JSON object Required: Yes "properties": { "container Control": false, "geometry": { "width": 150, "height": 150 } } This property defines the engineering properties required for each framework control and describes general control properties. • container Control {Boolean}, not required: Specifies whether the control is a container control and can include additional controls using drag and drop. In this case, the control must also be derived [} 1538] (directly or indirectly) from Tc Hmi Container Control. • geometry {JSON object}: Defines the default geometry properties (width and height) of the control, which are set after dropping the control from the toolbox. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.13 icons Type: Array of JSON objects Required: Yes "icons": [ { "name": "Icons/16x16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16 } ] This property defines the icon of the control in different dimensions. The array contains JSON objects, where each object corresponds to a control icon in a different resolution. The control icon is used to display the control in the toolbox of the Engineering and the Actions and Conditions Editor. The name is specified as a relative project path. The dimensions (width/height) are specified in pixels. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.14 dependency Files Type: Array of JSON objects Required: Yes "dependency Files": [ { "name": "Control.js", "type": "Java Script", "description": "" }, TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1539
## Page 1540

Framework { "name": "Style.css", "type": "Stylesheet", "description": "Theme independent style" } ] This property contains all files of the framework control that must be included in the HTML file of the HMI. By default, the Control.js and Style.css files are included. If additional Java Script or stylesheet files are included in the control, they must be referenced under "dependency Files". The array contains JSON objects that contain information about the file: • name {string}: file name and file extension with the relative project path to the file. • type {string}: File type (Java Script or Stylesheet) • description {string}: Optional file description. Theme-dependent stylesheet files are not included under "dependency Files", but under "themes [} 1540]". Even if the control is created via Type Script, the compiled Java Script file must be referenced here. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.15 themes Type: JSON object of JSON objects Required: No "themes": { "Base": { "resources": [ { "name": "Themes/Base/Style.css", "type": "Stylesheet", "description": "" } ] } } This property contains all themes that are included in the control. By default, the base theme is included with a stylesheet file. A theme is an object containing the array "resources". The array "resources" contains all the files that are allocated to a theme. A "resource" object contains the same properties as a "dependency File" object [} 1539], with other allowed values for "type": • name {string}: file name and file extension with the relative project path to the file. • type {string}: file type (Stylesheet or Themed Values, see Theming [} 1010]). • description {string}: Optional file description. Images and fonts etc. are not included under the theme resources, but referenced via the stylesheet file (see Theming [} 1010]). The following listing illustrates the inclusion of another theme with associated files: "themes": { "Base": { "resources": [ { "name": "Themes/Base/Style.css", "type": "Stylesheet", "description": "" } 1540 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

The attributes of the control are displayed in the Properties window of the Engineering under Show Properties. Any number of attributes can be defined in a control. The individual properties of an attribute are described on the following pages. Type: Indicates the data type of the property. Required: Indicates whether the property is required for the attribute (yes) or can be used optionally (no). 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 name Type: String Required: Yes "name": "data-tchmi-value" Name of the attribute. The name is written into the HTML code of the control as a "data-*" attribute. Therefore, the "data-" prefix is mandatory. The subsequent prefix "tchmi-" before the attribute is recommended for standardizing attributes, but it is not obligatory. An attribute name may only be used once for each control, otherwise unambiguous assignment cannot be guaranteed. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.2 property Name Type: String Required: Yes "property Name": "Value" TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1541
## Page 1542

Framework Internal attribute name of the control. The internal attribute name is formed from the attribute name without prefix in Pascal case. Example: "name": "data-tchmi-my-custom-value" becomes: „My Custom Value“. For better assignment between Java Script variables and attributes, it is recommended to name the attribute variable in the Java Script/Type Script code of Source.js according to the "property Name". 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.3 property Setter Name Type: String Required: Yes "property Setter Name": "set Value" This property creates the reference to the setter function in Source.js. The setter function allows a new value to be set. For the reference between Description.json and Source.js, the setter function must have the same name as the"property Setter Name". If the names in Description.json and Source.js/ts are different, an error message appears in the browser console and the setter function cannot be used. The recommended notation for the setter name is the "property Name" plus the prefix "set" in Camel case. If an attribute is read only [} 1545], the empty string should be entered as property Setter Name. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.4 property Getter Name Type: String Required: Yes "property Getter Name": "get Value" This property creates the reference to the getter function in Source.js/ts. The getter function returns the attribute value when called. For the reference between Description.json and Source.js, the getter function must have the same name as the"property Getter Name". If the names in Description.json and Source.js/ ts are different, an error message appears in the browser console and the getter function cannot be used. The recommended notation for the getter name is the "property Name" plus the prefix "get" in Camel case. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.5 display Name Type: String Required: Yes "display Name": "Value" The property is the name of the attribute displayed in the Engineering Properties window for the attribute. You can choose any "display Name". It is recommended that the "display Name" is based on the "property Name". 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.6 ref To Type: String Required: No "ref To": "base Property Name" Name of a Property Name of the control. This attribute references another attribute. 1542 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework This is used to write the physical unit (pixel or percent) in the development environment next to the numeric value. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.7 search Terms Type: Array of strings Required: No "search Terms": [ "Shortcut1", "Short Cut2", "Shortcut3" ] This property defines a list of search terms for Engineering to optimize the search function within the Actions and Conditions Editor and the Properties window. This makes it possible to find the attribute using terms other than the attribute name. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.8 visible Type: Boolean Required: No "visible": true This property determines whether the attribute is to be displayed in the Engineering. If the property is set to "false", the attribute is not available in the Engineering. By default, all attributes are displayed in the Engineering. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.9 themeable Type: Enum string Required: No "themeable": "Standard" This property determines whether the attribute is displayed in the theme editor in the Engineering. Permissible values: • Standard: The attribute is displayed in the theme editor. • None: The attribute is not displayed in the theme editor. • Advanced: The attribute is only displayed in the theme editor if the "Advanced" property is activated in the theme editor. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 type 0 Type: String (Tc Hmi data type) Required: Yes "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean" This property indicates the data types of the attribute. All data types of the Twin CAT HMI [} 93] are available. Further user-specific data types can be defined (see data Types [} 1551]). The data type determines the display of the attribute in the Engineering Properties window (e.g. checkbox for a Boolean value). 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 display Priority 1 Type: Number Required: No "display Priority": 10 TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1543
## Page 1544

Framework This property determines the priority with which the attribute is displayed within the category in the Engineering Properties window. User-specific sorting of attributes is possible based on the priority. Attributes with the same priority are displayed according to the order in which they are defined. The prioritization of the attribute categories is set via the property "attribut Categories [} 1547]". • Values less than 10 have high priority and are displayed higher up in the category, according to the value. • Values that equal 10 have main attributes like top, left etc. • Values greater than 10 have low priority and are displayed lower down in the category, according to the value. • Values greater than 50 are collapsed by default and have to be expanded using the arrow. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 allowed Functions 2 Type: JSON object Required: No "allowed Functions": { "return Type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/String", "required Arguments": [ { "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Number" } ], "required Wait Mode": "Synchronous" } For attributes with the data type [} 1543]: "type": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Function" These properties can only be used for "Function" type attributes. This property determines which functions are allowed for the attribute. This means that when configuring the attribute, only those functions are displayed that meet the defined criteria. A selected function may allow additional parameters. These parameters can be specified for each instance in engineering. Attributes: • return Type {string}: Determines which Twin CAT HMI data type may be returned by the function. • required Arguments {array of JSON objects}: Determines which Twin CAT HMI data types the functions may have as parameter values. The parameters mentioned here are set by the control. • required Wait Mode {enum string}: Determines in which mode (synchronous, asynchronous) the function may be executed (Synchronous, Asynchronous). For example, one the Beckhoff controls that uses this property is Linear Gauge [} 433], namely for the Value Format [} 455] in order to restrict the functions that can format the values of the gauge. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 category 3 Type: String Required: No "category": "Value" This property indicates the category to which the attribute is assigned in the Engineering Properties window. New category names can be assigned or standard category names (e.g. Common) can be used. A new category name does not have to exist under the Attribute categories [} 1547], since the category is created independently of the attribute categories. The attribute categories are used to prioritize different attribute categories. 1544 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 description 4 Type: String Required: No "description": "This description text will be used as a Tooltip in Visual Studio." This property contains the description of the attribute, which is displayed as a tooltip when the mouse is moved over the attribute. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 required On Compile 5 Type: Boolean Required: No "required On Compile": false This property determines whether the attribute of the control is required when the HMI is compiled. If the attribute is required for the control and the property is not set, an error message is issued and the control is not valid. This property is normally not required for attributes of a framework control. An example of "required On Compile" is the id of a control. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 read Only 6 Type: Boolean Required: No "read Only": false This property indicates whether the Engineering has write access to the attribute or only read access. By default, write access to an attribute is available. If read Only is set to true, the attribute is no longer displayed in the Engineering Properties window, but it can still be used via the Actions and Conditions Editor. For read only attributes, the property Setter Name [} 1542] is not required and can be replaced by an empty string. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 bindable 7 Type: Boolean Required: No "bindable": true This property indicates whether a data Binding [} 109] to the attribute can be created in the Engineering. By default, the property is true. If the property is set to false, it is not possible to link symbols to the attribute. Nevertheless, this attribute can be used and read at another location. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 heritable 8 Type: Boolean Required: No "heritable": true This property indicates whether the attribute can be passed on to other control. By default, the property is true. If the property is set to false, it is not available in the derived control classes. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1545
## Page 1546

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.1 allow Symbol Expressions In Object 9 Type: Boolean Required: No "allow Symbol Expressions In Object": false This property specifies whether the attribute setter [} 1564] can process symbol expressions within an object. This setting is not relevant if the values of an attribute are not objects (e.g. string, Boolean, number). By default, the property is false. If this setting is true, engineering allows a selection of symbols in the editor. The control receives such an object at runtime, for example: { "start": "%i%myinternalsymbol%/i%", "end": 35.0 } For step-by-step instructions on how these data types are processed, see Handling of symbol expressions in objects [} 1580] 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.2 default Binding Mode 0 Type: Boolean Required: No "default Binding Mode": "One Way" This property specifies how a binding to this attribute should be handled. Permissible values: • One Way: By default, a binding to the attribute is only valid for writing to the control. This is the default. • Two Way: By default, a binding to the attribute is valid for reading to and writing from the control. The new value is written to the binding each time the respective attribute is changed. See also Configure binding [} 112] 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.2 default Value 1 Type: Data type of the attribute Required: No "default Value": false This property indicates the default value for the attribute that is used in the Engineering Properties window when instantiating the control and written to the HTML code. If null is entered here, no attribute is set. 1546 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1547

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.16.2 default Value Internal 2 Type: Data type of the attribute Required: No "default Value Internal": false This property specifies the internal default value for the attribute. This value is passed to the Setter function [} 1542] when the control is initialized. The internal default may differ from the normal default [} 1546] ("drop default"). 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.17 attribute Categories Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "attribute Categories": [ { "name": "Value", "display Priority": 500, "default Collapsed": false, "description": "" } ] The property is used to prioritize new attribute categories that are assigned under Attributes [} 1544]. Prioritization is used to determine the displayed order of the categories in the Engineering Properties window. The attribute categories are described within a JSON object. The following properties can be defined: • name {String}: The name of the attribute category. The attribute name must be assigned to at least one control attribute. • display Priority {Number}: The priority determines the order in which the various attribute categories are displayed within the Engineering Properties window. ◦ Values less than 10 mean high priority and are displayed at the top of the Properties window (e.g. colors). ◦ Values less than 500 have standard categories (e.g. Common =100, Layout = 200, Border = 300, Background Image = 400). ◦ Values greater than 500 should be assigned user-specific categories so that they are listed below the standard categories. ◦ Values greater than 800 have low priority and are rarely configured. • default Collapsed {Boolean}, not required: This property determines whether the category is collapsed by default (true) or expanded (false). • description {String}, not required: Optional description of the attribute category that is displayed as a tooltip for the mouseover event in the Engineering. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.18 themed Resources Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "themed Resources": [ { "name": "My Custom Themed Resource", "display Name": "My Custom Themed Resource", "description": "This is a custom themed resource. Look at theming of framework controls.", "type": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/My Themed Definition" } ] TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1547
## Page 1548

Framework This property contains all user-specific theme definitions that are not defined as attributes in the Engineering Properties window and can only be changed using the theme editor. An example of a "Themed Resource" are images within a control that cannot be exchanged via the Properties window (e.g. Knob Config Horizontal and Knob Config Vertical for the Linear Gauge [} 433]). A control developer can access these resources via the Tc Hmi. Theme.get API. A "themed Resources" object contains the following properties: • name {String}: Name of the property to be changed. • display Name {String}: Name displayed in the Engineering theme editor. • description {String}: Optional description of the property that is displayed in the theme editor on mouseover. • type {String of a framework data type} [} 93]: Data type of the property. The data type can be either a Twin CAT HMI data type or a user-specific data type defined under "data Types [} 1551]". Usually, user- specific data types are used (see Theming). 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.19 functions MType: Array of JSON objects Required: No "functions": [ { "name": "custom Function", "display Name": "custom Function", "visible": true, "description": "This is a sample for a function that can be called.", "category": "Actions", "params": [], "type": null, "heritable": true, "search Terms": [] } ] This property defines functions of the control that are independent of attributes. The functions can optionally have parameter values or a return value. Each function must have the same name in Source.js, otherwise an error message appears in the browser console and the function is not executed. A JSON object for a function contains the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the function. • display Name {String}: Name of the function that is displayed in the Engineering. • description {String}: Description of the function that is displayed as a tooltip during mouseover in the engineering. • category {String}: Category of the function under which the function is displayed in the Actions and Conditions Editor in the Engineering. • params [} 1549] {JSON object}, not required: Parameter values of the function. • type {string, Twin CAT HMI data type}: Return value of the function. The return value must have a Twin CAT HMI data type. • heritable {Boolean}: This property defines whether the function is to be passed on to derived classes. • search Terms {array of strings}, not required: This property defines search terms for the Engineering that are to optimize the search function within the Actions & Conditions Editor. This makes it possible to find the function using terms other than the function name. For example, if the strings "My Function" and "1234" are added to the array, the function can also be found under these terms. The following diagram shows an example of two framework control functions in engineering, neither of which has a return value. A function contains optional parameter values. 1548 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1549

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.19.1 params Type: JSON object Required: No "params": [ { "name": "function Parameter1", "display Name": "function Parameter1", "description": "This is a sample for a function parameter.", "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Number", "visible": true }, { "name": "function Parameter2", "display Name": "function Parameter2", "description": "This is a sample for a function parameter.", "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean", "bindable": false "visible": true } ] This property defines the optional parameter vaules of a function. The parameter values can be transferred via Engineering. A parameter object contains the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the parameter values. • display Name {String}: Name of the parameter value that is displayed in the Engineering. • description {String}: Description of the parameter value that is displayed as a tooltip during mouseover in the Engineering. • bindable {Boolean}: Determines whether a binding [} 109] can be set to this parameter. This is allowed by default. • visible {Boolean}: Visibility of the parameter value. The visibility determines whether the parameter is to be displayed or hidden in the Engineering. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.20 events Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1549
## Page 1550

Framework "events": [ { "name": ".on My Custom Event", "display Name": ".on My Custom Event", "visible": true, "display Priority": 30, "category": "Control", "description": "This is a sample for a framework control event.", "heritable": true, "allows Prevent Default": false } ] This property defines events that can be configured through the Engineering and are triggered in this framework control. An event is used to notify engineering that a specific event has occurred in the control. The HMI developer in engineering has the option to respond to this event accordingly. Triggering of an event is implemented in Source.js. An event object contains the following properties: • name {String}: internal name of the event. • display Name {String}: name of the function that is displayed in the Engineering. • visible {Boolean}: visibility of the event. If "visible" is set to "false", the event is not displayed in the Engineering. • display Priority {Number}, not required: the priority determines the order in which the various events are displayed within the category. ◦ Values = 10 correspond to frequently used events such as ".on Pressed". ◦ Values = 15 correspond to standard events such as ".on Click" or "on Right Click". ◦ Values = 50 correspond to rarely used events such as ".on Mouse Up". ◦ No value assigned: the event is collapsed by default and has to be expanded using the arrow. • category {String}: the category determines under which category the event is listed in the Engineering. Existing categories such as "Operator" can be used, or new category names can be assigned. • description {String}: optional description of the event, which is displayed as a tooltip on mouseover in the Engineering. • heritable {Boolean}: this property defines whether the event is to be inherited to derived classes. By default, this value is "true", so that the event is inherited. • allows Prevent Default {Boolean}, not required: this property specifies that a user can explicitly select prevent Default. See also Events [} 1570] The event configured above is displayed in the Engineering as follows: 1550 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.21 data Types Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "data Types": [ { "schema": "Schema/Type Definitions/Custom Datatype. Schema.json" } ] This property contains a list of files in which all user-specific data types of the control are defined. Each file can describe any number of data types. Developer can define their own data types in a JSON schema. The definition usually takes place under "Schema\Type Definitions [} 1485]". In order for the Engineering to know and be able to process the user-specific data types, they must be referenced in Description.json. A data Type object contains the following properties: • schema {String, relative path}: relative path to the JSON schema file describing the data type. 14.2.2.2.3.1.2.22 access Type: Array of JSON objects Required: No "access": [ { "name": "my Custom Right", "display Name": "my Custom Right", "description": "This is a sample for access rights in the framework control.", "visible": true, TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1551
## Page 1552

Framework "default Value Internal": null } ] This property contains a list of user-specific access rights that can be configured via the Engineering. Access rights restrict user groups in their activities (see authorization system [} 970]). A user-specific access right must be evaluated in Source.js with corresponding user-specific logic [} 1570]. An access right object contains the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the access right. • display Name {String}: Name of the access right that is displayed in the Engineering. • description {String}: Description of the access right, which is displayed as a tooltip in the Engineering on mouseover. • visible {Boolean}: This property switches the visibility of the access right. If "visible" is set to "false", the access right is not displayed in the Engineering. • default Value Internal {Boolean}: This property defines the internal default value that is to apply if the access right is not configured via engineering. "true" means access is granted by default. "false" means access is not granted. "null" means access is not defined and the parent control is queried. If the parent control does not know this right, the value set here applies. For a detailed description of the behavior of default Value Internal see authorization system [} 970]. Various user groups are assigned to an access right via the Engineering, which are structured according to the following schema: tchmi:framework#/definitions/Control Access Right This schema defines the type of access (Allow, Deny, Inherit) the respective user group has to the access right. In the Engineering, the access right is displayed in the Properties window as follows (for two different user groups): For more information, see section Access rights [} 1570]. 14.2.2.2.3.2 Template.html Like every control in the Twin CAT HMI, a framework control is based on HTML code. As soon as a framework control is instantiated in the Engineering of the Twin CAT HMI, an HTML div element is automatically created for the control. The developer of the framework control can define additional HTML code for the control within the control div element. 1552 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1553

Framework HTML/SVG code The definition of the HTML/SVG code is implemented in the "Template.html" file. The use of this file is optional. The Template.html file is only used if it is referenced in Description.json [} 1538] of the control. The Template.html file defines the basic structure of a framework control. <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-Template tchmi-box"> <!--Place your code here--> </div> The HTML/SVG code defined within this file is automatically inserted in the control div element (if the file is used) in the engineering. The code can be viewed in the browser during debugging, for example. <div id="Tc Hmi Framework Control Js1" data-tchmi-type=" Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj1. Framework Control Js1" data-tchmi-height="150" data-tchmi-height- unit="px" data-tchmi-left="137" data-tchmi-left-unit="px" data-tchmi-top="140" data-tchmi-top- unit="px" data-tchmi-value="True" data-tchmi-width="150" data-tchmi-width-unit="px" class="tchmi-box tchmi-control framework-control-js1" title="" style="left: 137px; top: 140px; width: 150px; height: 150px; z-index: 0; border-width: 0px;"> <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Ts1-Template tchmi-box"> <!--Place your code here--> </div> </div> SVG elements can also be embedded directly. <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Ts1-Template tchmi-box"> <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Ts1-Template-div1 tchmi-box"></div> <svg class=" Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Ts1-Template-svg1 tchmi-box" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="100%" view Box="0 0 30 30" enable-background="new 0 0 30 30" xml:space="preserve"> <polyline class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Ts1-Template-svg1-arrow" stroke- width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" points="22.865,12.5 15,20.366 7.135,12.5"></polyline> </svg> <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Ts1-Template-div2 tchmi-box"></div> Within the Template.html file any number of HTML/SVG elements can be defined. All standard HTML/SVG elements are available to the developer. In addition to the standard HTML elements, Twin CAT HMI controls can also be used in the Template.html file. See Dynamic control generation [} 1582]. The user-specific HTML code should be placed within the template div ("Place your code here"). Do not assign fixed IDs No fixed IDs may be assigned within the Template.html file. The assignment of IDs within the Template.html file would contradict the concept of multiple instantiations of a framework control, since an ID may only occur once within the HTML document. The outer control div element is automatically assigned a unique ID through the Engineering. This ID is made available via the placeholder {Id}. A div element may be created in this way: <div id=“{Id}-sub Div“></div> CSS classes Within the elements in the Template.html file, CSS classes [} 1554] can be assigned, which are described via cascading style sheets files, either detached from the theme or depending on the theme. By default, the template class in the Style.css file is used at project level. Access via Java Script/Type Script The HTML elements defined within the Template.html file can be further processed in the Source.js/ts file [} 1557]. The elements can be changed during runtime or used as placeholders for dynamically created elements, for example. Processing of the HTML elements in the Source.js/ts file is optional. Static use within the Template.html file is also possible. If the HTML elements are to be processed further in the Source.js/ts file, references to the HTML elements must be created there. References to the Template.html file are created within the Prev Init function in the Source.js file. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1553

Framework /** Handle template elements. Should be done before call to __previnit of super class. */ this.__element Template Root = this.get Element().find('. Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-Template'); The listing shows the access to the template div within Template.html. A search for the template div is initiated using the ".find()" JQuery function within the main JQuery object of the control. The reference to the JQuery object of the control can be reached via ".get Element()". If additional elements are placed within the template div, they can also be found using the ".find()" JQuery function. For performance reasons, we recommend to avoid using the outer JQuery object for the search in cases with many nested elements, but to use the inner elements that are already referenced instead. Sample: <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-Template tchmi-box"> <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-inner-div"> <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-inner-div-my-element"> </div> </div> </div> The following references result from this HTML code: /** Handle template elements. Should be done before call to __previnit of super class. */ this.__element Template Root = this.get Element().find('.

Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-inner- div-my-element'); 14.2.2.2.3.3 Style.css Within a framework control, the appearance of individual elements is described using cascading style sheets. The default design of the control is defined in the Style.css file at the project level and in the Style.css file, the base theme of the control. In addition to the standard design, further themes can be defined for the framework control. The appearance of a framework control can be changed at four different levels [} 1021] according to the theme system of the Twin CAT HMI. 14.2.2.2.3.3.1 Theme levels The appearance of a framework control can be described at different levels of the theme system [} 1021]. Level 4: Attribute definition per control type Control themes [} 1016] can be defined at level 4 of the theme system. Control themes allow individual attributes of the framework control to be overwritten. A control theme is defined within a theme file and can be created using the theme editor in Engineering or directly as JSON code. The theme file must be assigned to a specific theme within the project: The theme file must then be referenced as "Themed Values" under "themes [} 1540]" in the Description.json file. 1554 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1555

Framework Level 5: Attribute definition by Default Value Internal At level 5 of the theme system, it is possible to set the properties of the attribute via Default Value Internal [} 1547]. Default Value Internal can be set in the Description.json file of the framework control. Example of a color attribute: "default Value Internal": { "color": "rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)" } Level 8: Cascading Style Sheets per theme Cascading style sheet files can be added to a theme at level 8 of the theme system. Within the CSS file any element properties can be defined. The CSS file "Stylesheet" must then be referenced under "themes [} 1540]" in the Description.json file of the framework control. Level 9: Cascading Style Sheets on project level in the control At level 9 of the theme system, Cascading Style Sheet files can be added independently of a theme at project level in the control. By default, each framework control project contains a Style.css file at project level. Within this file, element properties are defined that are to apply independently of a theme (e.g. sizes of a div). All CSS files at the project level in the control must be referenced under dependency Files [} 1539] in the Description.json file of the framework control. 14.2.2.2.3.3.2 Using CSS classes The CSS class selectors are used within the cascading style sheet files of a framework control. Permitted selectors The following CSS selectors can be used conditionally within a CSS file of a framework control: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1555
## Page 1556

Framework • Type selectors • Attribute selectors • Class selectors With class selectors, new CSS classes are defined for a framework control, which means that CSS styles are not overwritten outside the framework control. If type or attribute selectors are to be used, you must ensure that they are only used for the class of the framework control and do not overwrite any styles outside the framework control (descendant selector): . Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1 a { color: red; } The following CSS selectors should not be used within a CSS file of a framework control: • ID selectors: Due to multiple instantiation, you cannot assign fixed IDs within a framework control. • Universal selector: A framework control should not overwrite any styles outside the control during instantiation. Using the class selectors CSS classes can be used in the Template.html file, or they can be added dynamically at runtime within the Source.js/ts file. . Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-template { width: 100%; height: 100%; } Within the Template.html file, a CSS class is assigned via the HTML attribute "class": <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-template tchmi-box"> </div> The class "tchmi-box" sets CSS properties to facilitate element positioning and can be used with all positioned HTML elements. The dynamic use of a CSS class within Source.js can be realized via the j Query function ".add Class()", for example: this.__element Template Root.add Class('Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-my-custom- class'); 14.2.2.2.3.3.3 Overwriting CSS of controls Within the CSS files it is possible to overwrite the appearance of embedded Twin CAT HMI controls. For example, if you want to change the appearance of an embedded button within a control, you can do this by applying the CSS styles of the button. Please ensure that all buttons are not inadvertently assigned this appearance and that the CSS file of the general button does not overwrite that of the embedded control. Both can be achieved by so-called descendant selectors (spaces in CSS): . Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1 . Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Button { background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, #eff1f3, #aeb9c2); color: #4794da; box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); } . Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1 . Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Button.down { background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, #aeb9c2, #eff1f3); color: #000000; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.6); } 1556 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1557

Framework All main elements of a control are assigned the control name (extended by the namespace) as CSS class name (here Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1). If this is attached before the style of the control to be overwritten, the new appearance in the example only applies to buttons below the framework control. CSS selectors are always read from right to left: • First example: Main element of the button (". Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Button") if it is located under (" ") of Framework Control Js1 (". Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1"). • Second example: Element with class down (".down") if it is the main element of the button (". Tc Hmi_Controls_Beckhoff_Tc Hmi Button"), if it is below (" ") of Framework Control Js1 (". Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1"). 14.2.2.2.3.4 Control.ts/js A framework control requires Java Script code or Type Script code. Browsers cannot execute Type Script, so an additional compilation step turns Type Script code into corresponding Java Script code. Type Script extends the syntax of Java Script with information about data type and access rights. Java Script code is written directly in the Control.js file. Both file types (Control.js and Control.ts) define the base framework for the implementation of a framework control and can be extended flexibly. See also Creating a control [} 1535]. Programming conventions The programming conventions provide a base for standardizing framework controls. They are used to distinguish between internal and external access. • Member variables are marked with the prefix"__" and in Camel case: this.__my Var = …; • Functions with external access (Engineering: setter/getter functions) are identified without prefix and in Camel case: set My Var() { /* … */ } • Internal functions are marked with the prefix "__" and in Camel case: __process My Var() { /* … */ } Source code analysis with eslint The project directory contains a file .eslintrc.json. This can be used to enter rules for the source code analysis tool eslint for all Java Script and also Type Script files. By default a few rules are already active there, which can detect actual program errors. The documentation under https://eslint.org/docs/rules/ lists all possible rules in detail. If you make changes in the Control.js file and the framework control is already associated with an HMI project, you must then carry out a project build [} 1536] of the framework control to apply the changes. A corresponding Java Script file is automatically created from the Type Script files. 14.2.2.2.3.4.1 Control life cycle The control life cycle describes which system function of the control is called by the system at which time. In the control life cycle, a distinction is made as to whether the control is on an HMI page for which preloading is activated. The basic control life cycle is described in the following diagram: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1557
## Page 1558

Framework Explanations: 1. The constructor is called during control instantiation. 2. The Prev Init function is called after the constructor and before the attribute setter functions are called. 3. The attribute setter functions are called after the Prev Init function. 4. The Init function is called after the attribute setter functions. At this point, the control attributes are initialized by the attribute setter functions and have valid values. 5. The Attach function is called after the Init function, once the control has been added to the DOM on the HMI page. 6. The Detach function is called after a control has been removed from the DOM of the HMI page (e.g. during page switching). 7. The Destroy function is called after the control has been removed from the DOM of the HMI page, so that the system can destroy the controls. In addition, the Destroy function can be called explicitly at another point (for example, when subordinate controls are destroyed). HMI page: Preload disabled Normally, preloading of an HMI page is disabled ("Preload this partial: false" as setting for a Content file [} 796]), which means that the controls are not stored in the browser cache. This increases the speed of the initial HMI loading process, but it can lead to a reduction in the loading speed of individual HMI pages on which many controls are instantiated. Memory consumption is also reduced because the pages are no longer in memory when they are not active. In this case, the constructor of the control is called when the page is loaded (for example, when switching to the page or when loading the start page). This is followed by the Prev Init function, the attribute setter functions, the Init function and the Attach function. As soon as the page is unloaded (e.g. when switching to another page), the Detach function is called, followed by the Destroy function. The life cycle of the controls starts again when the HMI page is loaded. HMI page: Preload enabled If preloading is enabled for an HMI page ("Preload this partial: true" as setting for a Content file [} 796]), the controls are stored in the browser cache. This increases the loading speed of a single HMI page, but it can lead to a reduction in the initial loading process of the HMI. Furthermore, memory consumption is increased because all preloaded pages are always in memory, even if they are never activated. In this case, the constructor of the control is called as soon as the HMI is initially loaded. This is followed by the Prev Init function, the attribute setter functions and the Init function. The Attach function of the control is not called until the HMI page on which the control is instantiated is loaded. The Detach function is called as soon as the HMI page is unloaded. The Destroy function is not called automatically subsequently. The control remains in the browser cache. When the HMI page is reloaded, the Attach function is called directly. 1558 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1559

Framework HMI page: Keep Alive enabled If Keep Alive is enabled for an HMI page ("Keep Alive this partial: true" as setting for a Content file [} 796]), the controls are kept in the browser cache. This increases the loading speed of a single HMI page if it is called several times. The controls of a page are created when the page is accessed for the first time. They are retained when the page is exited. This only slightly increases memory consumption, since only those pages remain in memory that were enabled once. Pages with Keep Alive are therefore kept in memory similar to Preload when they are no longer needed. In contrast, these pages are not loaded initially. This ensures fast loading of the entire application. In this case, the constructor of the control is called when the page is loaded (for example, when switching to the page or when loading the start page). This is followed by the Prev Init function, the attribute setter functions and the Init function. The Attach function of the control is not called until the HMI page on which the control is instantiated is loaded. The Detach function is called as soon as the HMI page is unloaded. The Destroy function is not called automatically subsequently. The control remains in the browser cache. When the HMI page is reloaded, the Attach function is called directly. 14.2.2.2.3.4.2 Base framework The Control.js/ts file already contains preconfigured source code that is required for various functions of the framework control and may not be modified in some cases. A framework control corresponds to a class, of which concrete instances (objects) are created at a later time.

Framework /* * Generated 2/15/2020 10:57:13 AM * Copyright User XY 2020 * ........................ */ These comment lines contain information about the creation of the framework control, which is generated automatically when the framework control project is created. These lines are not required for using the control. Do not change the basic structure of the framework control within Control.js/ts. There is a risk that the control can no longer be used. Basic structure of a Type Script framework control Note: In old templates, modules Tc Hmi was used instead of namespace Tc Hmi. The resulting Java Script code is exactly the same. However, this syntax is outdated and is therefore no longer used in newer templates. namespace Tc Hmi. Controls { export namespace Framework Prj1 { export class Framework Prj1Control extends Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control { constructor(element: JQuery, pc Element: JQuery, attrs: Tc Hmi. Controls. Control Attribute List) { super(element, pc Element, attrs); } /** Control specific logic */ } } } Tc Hmi. Controls.register Ex('Framework Prj1Control', 'Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj1', Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj1. Framework Prj1Control); Basic structure of a Java Script framework control The basic structure of version 1.8 and 1.10 controls [} 1508] is still supported. However, it is recommended to use Type Script or this Javascipt syntax for new controls: (function (/** @type {global This. Tc Hmi} */ Tc Hmi) { let Controls; (function (/** @type {global This. Tc Hmi. Controls} */ Controls) { let Framework Prj1; (function (Framework Prj1) { class Framework Control Js1 extends Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control { constructor(element, pc Element, attrs) { super(element, pc Element, attrs); } /** Control specific logic */ } Framework Prj1. Framework Control Js1 = Framework Control Js1; })(Framework Prj1 = Controls. Framework Prj1 || (Controls. Framework Prj1 = {})); Controls.register Ex('Framework Control Js1', 'Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj1', Framework Prj1. Framework Control Js1); })(Controls = Tc Hmi. Controls || (Tc Hmi. Controls = {})); })(Tc Hmi || (Tc Hmi = {})); This code defines the basic structure of a framework control and is required for using the control at runtime. In the event of invalid changes, the control can no longer be used properly. Definition of the namespaces Within Control.js, various namespaces are referenced and defined, which are required for the framework. Many of these definitions are unnecessary in Type Script. 1560 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1561

Framework Tc Hmi (function (/** @type {global This. Tc Hmi} */ Tc Hmi) { })(Tc Hmi); This function makes the control known within the "Tc Hmi" namespace. The framework cannot be accessed outside this namespace. Controls (function (/** @type {global This. Tc Hmi. Controls} */ Controls) { })(Controls = Tc Hmi. Controls || (Tc Hmi. Controls = {})); This function makes the control known within the "Controls" namespace. This namespace contains all Twin CAT HMI controls (System [} 754], Beckhoff [} 124], Custom). The control is registered in the control namespace which is required for the Engineering of the Twin CAT HMI. Controls.register Ex('Framework Control Js1', 'Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj1', Framework Prj1. Framework Control Js1); Own namespace var Framework Prj1; (function (Framework Prj1) { })(Framework Prj1= Controls. Framework Prj1 || (Controls. Framework Prj1 = {})); This function defines the namespace for user-specific controls and makes the control known within the namespace. The concrete framework control object is defined in the Framework Prj1 namespace and then assigned to the Framework Prj1 namespace: Framework Prj1. Framework Control Js1 = Framework Control Js1; Control class A framework control is defined by a Java Script class within the Framework Prj1 namespace. The logic is implemented in this section (Constructor [} 1561], System functions [} 1562], Attributes [} 1564], Functions [} 1567], Events [} 1570], Access rights [} 1570]). let Framework Prj1; (function (Framework Prj1) { class Framework Control Js1 extends Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control { constructor(element, pc Element, attrs) { super(element, pc Element, attrs); } /** Control specific logic */ } For the framework control the class of the base control [} 1538] (usually Tc Hmi Control [} 754]) defined in Description.json [} 1536] is specified. The framework control inherits all properties of the defined base control. The framework control is defined by a class within which the user-specific code of the framework control is implemented. When a specific instance (Java Script object) is created by the class, the instance has all the properties of the class. 14.2.2.2.3.4.3 Constructor Each Type Script framework control contains a constructor that is structured as follows: export class Framework Prj1Control extends Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control { constructor(element: JQuery, pc Element: JQuery, attrs: Tc Hmi. Controls. Control Attribute List) { super(element, pc Element, attrs); } } Each Java Script framework control contains a constructor that is structured as follows: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1561
## Page 1562

Framework class Framework Control Js1 extends Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control { constructor(element, pc Element, attrs) { super(element, pc Element, attrs); } } The parameter values of the constructor are only used internally and forwarded to the base constructor call. With Java Script controls, the internal variables of the control (member variables) are initialized with "undefined" within the constructor. Initialization at this point is not necessary, but is recommended for better clarity. 14.2.2.2.3.4.4 System functions Framework controls have functions that are called by the system at different times. Each system function calls the respective system function of the base class (Tc Hmi Control [} 754]) via the "super" object. Prev Init function Type Script: protected __element Template Root!: JQuery; public __previnit() { /** Handle template elements. Should be done before call to __previnit of super class. */ this.__element Template Root = this.get Element().find('. Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-Template'); /** Call __previnit of super class. */ super.__previnit(); } If variables (such as __element Template Root) are written with the final value in Prev Init, they do not need the type undefined. In this case the type JQuery is sufficient. To notify Type Script that these variables are still not used uninitialized, the Definite Assignment Assertion operator must be used with an exclamation mark. Java Script: __previnit() { /** Handle template elements. Should be done before call to __previnit of super class. */ this.__element Template Root = this.get Element().find('. Tc Hmi_Controls_Framework Prj1_Framework Control Js1-Template'); /** Call __previnit of super class. */ super.__previnit(); } The Prev Init function is automatically called after the system calls the constructor [} 1561] and before the attribute setters of each attribute are called. Accordingly, the member variables of the attributes have the value "undefined" when the Prev Init function is called. Within the Prev Init function, the references [} 1552] to the HMTL elements are created from the Template.html file. This function may only be called by the system and not explicitly by the developer. Init function Type Script: public __init() { super.__init(); } Java Script: __init() { super.__init(); } 1562 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1563

Framework The Init function is called automatically by the system after the attribute setters of the individual attributes have been called. Accordingly, when the Init function is called, the member variables of the attributes already have the values that were passed to the control or defined internally as default values. This function may only be called by the system and not explicitly by the developer. Attach function Type Script: public __attach() { /** * Enable everything which was disabled while __detach function was called! */ /** * Initialize everything which is only available while the control is part of the active dom. */ /** Call base __attach function */ super.__attach(); } Java Script: __attach() { /** * Enable everything which was disabled while __detach function was called! */ /** * Initialize everything which is only available while the control is part of the active dom. */ /** Call base __attach function */ super.__attach(); } The Attach function is automatically called by the system after the current control instance has been added to the DOM of the HTML document. Within the Attach function, all calculations should be performed that are only available while the control instance is in the DOM (e.g. .get Bounding Client Rect() of DOM elements or .width() of j Query elements). The opposite of the Attach function is the Detach function. This function may only be called by the system and not explicitly by the developer. Detach function Type Script: public __detach() { /** * Disable everything which is not needed while the control is not part of the active dom. * No need to listen to events for example! */ /** Call base __detach function */ super.__detach(); } Java Script: __detach() { /** * Disable everything which is not needed while the control is not part of the active dom. * No need to listen to events for example! */ /** Call base __detach function */ super.__detach(); } The system automatically calls the Detach function after the current control instance has been removed from the DOM of the HTML document. In the Detach function, all functions that are no longer required after the control instance has been removed from the DOM are to be disabled. The opposite of the Detach function is the Attach function. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1563
## Page 1564

Framework This function may only be called by the system and not explicitly by the developer. Destroy function Type Script: public destroy() { if (this.__keep Alive) { return; } /** * Free resources */ /** Call base __destroy function */ super.destroy(); } Java Script: destroy() { if (this.__keep Alive) { return; } /** * Free resources like events etc. */ /** Call base __destroy function */ super.destroy(); } The system automatically calls the Destroy function when the control instance is no longer used (after the Detach function). If the control is on an HTML page where "Preload Partial" is enabled, the Destroy function is not called because the page is still saved in the browser cache. Within the Destroy function, the elements that were created during runtime are to be destroyed. This function can also be called explicitly (for example when child controls are destroyed). 14.2.2.2.3.4.5 Attributes Framework control attributes [} 1541] defined in Description.json must be initialized within Control.js, and the corresponding setter, getter and process methods must be implemented. The setter and getter methods provide central access to the attribute. The following samples refer to the following attribute, which is defined in Description.json under "attributes [} 1541]": "attributes": [ { "name": "data-tchmi-value", "property Name": "Value", "property Setter Name": "set Value", "property Getter Name": "get Value", "display Name": "Value", "visible": true, "themeable": "Standard", "display Priority": 10, "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean", "category": "Value", "description": "Important value", "read Only": false, "bindable": true, "heritable": true, "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": false } ] 1564 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1565

Framework Initialization (Type Script) The declaration of the attributes is implemented as a separate line in Type Script. Note that the data type must be defined for these attributes. Attributes are set late in the life cycle, so they should have undefined as a possible additional data type. The keyword protected specifies that only derived controls may access these variables, but not foreign controls. protected __value: boolean | undefined; Initialization (Java Script) The attributes are initialized in the constructor of the framework control. Initialization is not required here (variables without keywords are automatically initialized in Java Script when used), but is recommended for better clarity. this.__value = undefined; Member variables and functions that cannot be accessed from outside are prefixed with "__". Setter method The setter method of an attribute is only required for attributes that are not set to "read Only [} 1545]" (all attributes that can be set via Engineering). Like the definition, the setter method must be named in the "property Setter Name [} 1542]". Type Script: /** * Setter function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. * @param value New the new value or null */ public set Value(value New: boolean | null): void { // convert the value with the value converter let converted Value = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Boolean(value New); // check if the converted value is valid if (converted Value === null) { // if we have no value to set we have to fall back to the default Value Internal from description.json converted Value = this.get Attribute Default Value Internal('Value') as boolean; } if (tchmi_equal(converted Value, this.__value)) { // skip processing when the value has not changed return; } // remember the new value this.__value = converted Value; // inform the system that the function has a changed result. Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + '.on Property Changed', { property Name: 'Value' }); // call process function to process the new value this.__process Value(); } Java Script: /** * Setter function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. * @param {boolean} value New the new value or null * @returns {void} */ set Value(value New) { // convert the value with the value converter var converted Value = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Boolean(value New); // check if the converted value is valid if (converted Value === null) { // if we have no value to set we have to fall back to the default Value Internal from description.json TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1565
## Page 1566

Framework converted Value = this.get Attribute Default Value Internal('Value'); } if (tchmi_equal(converted Value, this.__value)) { // skip processing when the value has not changed return; } // remember the new value this.__value = converted Value; // inform the system that the function has a changed result. Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + '.on Property Changed', { property Name: 'Value' }); // call process function to process the new value this.__process Value(); } Within the setter method, the parameter that was passed is first converted into the expected data type by Engineering using the framework API function "Value Converter". If an invalid value is passed to the Value Converter or if the conversion of the value fails, the function returns "null". In this case the Default Value Internal [} 1547] from Description.json is used. The system then checks whether a value change to the last stored value of the attribute on the member variable has taken place. If no value change has taken place, the setter is exited. If a value change has taken place, the value of the member variable for the attribute is overwritten and the system is notified that a value change has taken place. Finally, the Process method is called for the value in which the response to the value change takes place. If the attribute contains an object (i.e. no basic data type such as string, Boolean, number), it can optionally contain symbol expressions. A detailed description of the adjustments for this case can be found in the article Handling of symbol expressions in objects [} 1580]. The function "tchmi_equal" should be used to check for a change in value. The JS comparison operator "===" can only check the basic Java Script data types but not complex JSON objects. Getter method The getter method of an attribute returns the current value of the attribute and is required for each attribute. Like the definition, the getter method must be named in the "property Getter Name [} 1542]". Type Script: /** * Getter function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. */ public get Value () { return this.__value; } Java Script: /** * Getter function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. * @returns {boolean} */ get Value () { return this.__value; } Process method The Process method is always called when the attribute value has been changed. The response to the value changes is to be implemented in the process method. For example, depending on a Boolean value elements can be switched visible or invisible, or a list can be created dynamically based on a transferred JSON object. Type Script: 1566 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework /** * Processor function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. */ protected __process Value() { // process actions with Value // ... } Java Script: /** * Processor function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. * @returns {void} */ __process Value() { // process actions with Value // ... } 14.2.2.2.3.4.6 Functions Framework control functions [} 1548] defined in Description.json must be defined and implemented in Control.js/ts. The function must be named like the "name [} 1548]" of the function in Description.json. Function without transfer parameters A function without transfer parameters is defined in Description.json as follows: "functions": [ { "name": "custom Function", "display Name": "custom Function", "visible": true, "description": "This is a sample for a function that can be called.", "category": "Actions", "params": [], "type": null, "heritable": true, "search Terms": [] } ] This results in the following code: Type Script: /** * This is the call of the api function 'custom Function'. */ public custom Function(): void { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the engineering in Visual Studio */ // implement function logic here } Java Script: /** * This is the call of the api function 'custom Function'. * @returns {void} */ custom Function() { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the engineering in Visual Studio */ // implement function logic here } Within the function, any execution logic of the function can be implemented. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1567
## Page 1568

Framework Function with return value The functions enables a return value to be returned to the calling point in Engineering. The data type [} 93] of the return value is defined in Description.json under "type". "functions": [ { "name": "custom Function2", "display Name": "custom Function2", "visible": true, "description": "This is a sample for a function that can be called by the engineering.", "category": "Actions", "params": [ ], "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean", "heritable": false, "searchterms": [] } ] Within the function in Control.js/ts it is then possible to return a value of the corresponding type. Type Script: /** * This is the call of the api function 'custom Function2'. */ public custom Function2 (): boolean { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the enginnering in the twincat */ // implement function logic here return true; } Java Script: /** * This is the call of the api function 'custom Function2'. * @returns {Boolean} */ custom Function2 () { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the enginnering in the twincat */ // implement function logic here return true; } Function with transfer parameters A function with transfer parameters [} 1549] is defined in Description.json as follows: "functions": [ { "name": "custom Function3", "display Name": "custom Function3", "visible": true, "description": "This is a sample for a function that can be called by the engineering.", "category": "Actions", "params": [ { "name": "function Parameter1", "display Name": "function Parameter1", "description": "This is a sample for a function parameter.", "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Number", "visible": true }, { "name": "function Parameter2", "display Name": "function Parameter2", "description": "This is a sample for a function parameter.", "type": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Boolean", "visible": true } ], 1568 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1569

Framework "type": null, "heritable": false, "searchterms": [] } ] The function is implemented in Control.js/ts like a normal function. The transfer parameters are transferred with the function call. The parameters must be checked for validity before they are used, similar to the attribute setters [} 1564]. Type Script: /** * This is the call of the api function 'custom Function3'. */ public custom Function3(function Parameter1: number, function Parameter2: boolean): void { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the enginnering in the twincat */ let converted Parameter1 = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Number(function Parameter1); if (converted Parameter1 === null) { // parameter is null: define what to do in this case // exit function call if the execution without this parameter is not possible return; } let converted Parameter2 = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Boolean(function Parameter2); if (converted Parameter2 === null) { // parameter is null: define what to do in this case // exit function call if the execution without this parameter is not possible return; } // implement function logic with the evaluation of the parameters here } Java Script: /** * This is the call of the api function 'custom Function3'. * @param {number} function Parameter1 * @param {boolean} function Parameter2 * @returns {void} */ custom Function3(function Parameter1, function Parameter2) { /** * custom Function is defined in the description.json and called from outside. * The api functions are shown in the graphical user interface of the engineering in Visual Studio */ var converted Parameter1 = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Number(function Parameter1); if (converted Parameter1 === null) { // parameter is null: define what to do in this case // exit function call if the execution without this parameter is not possible return; } var converted Parameter2 = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Boolean(function Parameter2); if (converted Parameter2 === null) { // parameter is null: define what to do in this case // exit function call if the execution without this parameter is not possible return; } // implement function logic with the evaluation of the parameters here } TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1569

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.4.7 Events Framework control events defined in Description.json should be triggered in Control.js/ts. The name of the event must be named like the "name [} 1549]" of the event in Description.json. An event can be triggered in different situations, e.g. when a certain record changes (see ".on Data Changed [} 251]" in the data grid [} 219]). An event is triggered in Control.js/ts via the Event Provider of the framework. The framework API function "Event Provider.raise()" is used for this purpose. When the event is triggered, the concrete control instance must be identified with "this.__id". // raise .on My Custom Event event Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + '.on My Custom Event'); Optionally, parameters can be passed to the event callbacks when the event is triggered. // declare parameter: type anything var my Parameter Object = 42; // raise .on My Custom Event event with event parameters Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + '.on My Custom Event', my Parameter Object); The response to the triggered events can take place in Engineering via the Properties window [} 61] or via the registration of the event in a Code Behind file [} 1480]. If allow Prevent Default is allowed in the event definition [} 1549], the my Parameter Object should offer prevent Default as a function. All DOM and j Query event objects meet this requirement, for example. This function is called if the user has set the option for this event in Engineering. 14.2.2.2.3.4.8 Access rights User-specific access rights [} 1551] defined in Description.json and configured in engineering [} 61] should be checked and evaluated in Control.js/ts. Depending on the user-specific access rights [} 964], specific elements can be switched visible or invisible or enabled or disabled, for example. The evaluation of the configured access rights is performed via the framework API function "Tc Hmi. Access.check Access()". The current instance of the control is passed to the function (this) and the name of the right to be checked, which must correspond to the definition in Description.json. // check user access of "my Custom Right" that is defined in the description.json if (Tc Hmi. Access.check Access(this, 'my Custom Right') === true) { // current user has the rights to do this // process actions with the right // show elements, enable buttons, etc. } else { // Current user has no rights to do this // process actions without the rights // hide elements, disable buttons, etc. } Since user management only works when authentication is active, the configured functions are not available in normal live view. From version 1.12 a live view with authentication is offered. 14.2.2.2.3.5 Custom Datatype. Schema.json Within a framework control project, user-specific and complex data types can be implemented if the data type is not covered by a standard data type. In principle, any data structures can be transferred as objects without the need for a user-specific data type. A user-specific data type is required if an editor is to be provided for generating the data in Engineering. The data editor is generically based on a given JSON schema. The following user-specific data types can be implemented: • Objects [} 1573] with fixed properties 1570 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1571

Framework • Array [} 1575] of any data types • Enumerations [} 1577] • Limitation [} 1578] of several allowed data types The usage within the Type Script/Java Script file is described in a separate documentation section [} 1579]. 14.2.2.2.3.5.1 Creating a custom data type Add a new element (New item...) in the Type Definitions folder under Schema. Add a new JSON file or JSON schema file to the project. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1571
## Page 1572

Framework Reference the schema file in Description.json under "data Types [} 1551]". Note that user-specific data types are assigned to the "Framework" category. "data Types": [ { "schema": "Schema/Type Definitions/Custom Datatype. Schema.json" } ] You can then use the user-specific data type within Description.json. "type": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Custom Datatype If the framework control is already referenced in an HMI project, a project build (see First Steps [} 1482]) must then be executed and the HMI project reloaded so that the new data type is included in the type descriptions of the HMI project. 14.2.2.2.3.5.2 Implementing a custom data type The configuration of a JSON schema for the framework follows a certain structure. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "{Datatype Name}": { "title": "{Datatype Name}", "type": "array", //... } } } Each JSON schema contains a definition that describes the data type ({Datatatype Name}). The definition of the data type contains the specification (type) and the description of the data type through attributes depending on the respective data type. 1572 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.5.2.1 Objects Objects can contain any properties. A property is described under Properties and can be refined through optional metadata (properties Meta). The following JSON schema describes an object with two properties. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "Custom Datatype": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "Custom Datatype", "type": "object", "engineering Columns": ["axis Name"], "properties Meta": [ { "name": "axis Name", "category": "Name", "display Name": "Axis Name", "display Priority": 10, "description": "axis name", "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": null }, { "name": "axis Color", "category": "Colors", "display Name": "Axis color", "display Priority": 10, "description": "axis color", "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": { "color": "#4794da" } } ], "properties": { "axis Name": { "type": "string" }, "axis Color": { "$ref": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Solid Color" } }, "required": [ "axis Name" ] } } } This results in the following generic data editor in Engineering. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1573
## Page 1574

Framework Explanations properties Meta: The metadata of the properties are optional. They describe the display within the generic data editor. The metadata are described by the following properties: • name {String}: Internal name of the property, see "name [} 1541]" in Description.json. Info: The name must match the name under the properties. • category {String}: Name of the category under which the property is displayed in the generic data editor, see "category [} 1544]" in Description.json. • display Name {String}: Name of the property displayed in the generic data editor, see "display Name [} 1542]" in Description.json. • display Priority {Number}: Priority of the display, see "display Priority [} 1543]" in Description.json. • description {String}: Description of the property, see "description [} 1545]" in Description.json. • default Value: Default value used initially in engineering, see "default Value [} 1546]" in Description.json. • default Value Internal: Internal default value, see "default Value Internal [} 1547]" in Description.json. properties: The name and data type of the object properties are described under Properties. The name is determined by the name of the property. The data type can be described as follows: • type {String}: Default JSON data type of the property, or • $ref {String, reference}: Reference to a framework data type. This can be implemented within the project or taken from the existing data type descriptions of the framework. 1574 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1575

Framework required: The required properties are listed under "required". The list is based on the internal name. If a property of the object that is set to required is not set in Engineering, the generic data editor displays a warning. engineering Columns: If this object is used as part of an array [} 1575], the values of these properties are displayed in the array overview. 14.2.2.2.3.5.2.2 Arrays Arrays can be created from simple data types and complex objects. Array of simple data types Simple data types are specified within the "items" property under the "type" data type property. The following schema defines an array of strings. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "Custom Datatype": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "Custom Datatype", "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } } } This schema generates the following generic data editor in Engineering. The generic data editor displays the array elements on the left-hand side under the name of the respective data type (in the sample: string). If a self-defined name is to be displayed instead, an object with a property of the type of the data type must be selected instead of the simple data type, and the "display Name" of the property must be set in the metadata. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1575
## Page 1576

Framework Array of complex data types Complex data types are specified in the property "items" under the reference property "$ref". The following schema defines an array of objects of data type "Custom Datatype". This data type was previously implemented as Object [} 1573]. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "My Array": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "My Array", "type": "array", "items": { "$ref": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Custom Datatype" } } } } Furthermore, it is possible to describe the object directly within the array definition. The following schema describes the same array with the definition of the object within the property "items". { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "My Array Inline Object": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "My Array Inline Object", "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "title": "Custom Object", "description": "Defines a custom object in the array.", "engineering Columns": ["axis Name"], "properties Meta": [ { "name": "axis Name", "category": "Name", "display Name": "Axis Name", "display Priority": 10, "description": "axis name", "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": null }, { "name": "axis Color", "category": "Colors", "display Name": "Axis color", "display Priority": 10, "description": "axis color", "default Value": null, "default Value Internal": { "color": "#4794da" } } ], "properties": { "axis Name": { "type": "string" }, "axis Color": { "$ref": "tchmi:framework#/definitions/Solid Color" } }, "required": [ "axis Name" ] } } } } Both schema files generate the following generic data editor in Engineering. 1576 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1577

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.5.2.3 Enumerations Enumerations can contain any elements for the data type string. In the Engineering, enumerations are not displayed in the generic data editor, but in the combo box in the Properties window. The permissible values of the enumeration are defined in the property "enum" in an array. The following schema defines an exemplary enumeration. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "My Enum": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "title": "My Enum", "type": "string", "enum": [ "My Value1", "My Value2", "My Value3", "My Value4" ] } } } This results in the following display in Engineering. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1577
## Page 1578

Framework 14.2.2.2.3.5.2.4 Restrict permitted data types User-specific data types can be restricted so that only certain data types can be transferred. As a result, when creating a binding [} 109] only the symbols corresponding to the permitted data types are displayed. The following schema defines an exemplary restriction of permissible values (one Of). Only values that have the data type "Time" or "Time Span" are permitted. { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "definitions": { "My Constrained Datatype": { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema", "one Of": [ { "title": "Time", "$ref": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Date Time" }, { "title": "Timespan", "$ref": "tchmi:general#/definitions/Time Span" } ] } } } The display in Engineering is normally an attribute. However, only bindings to symbols that correspond to the permitted data types can be created. 14.2.2.2.4 Extended functionalities Some advanced features and tips for developing controls are explained here. 1578 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1579

Framework 14.2.2.2.4.1 Handling of complex data types In many cases a control is intended to work with a complex data type, e.g. from the PLC. Alternatively, control configurations are to be created as an object or array. To do this, a JSON schema [} 1570] must be created and referenced [} 1551] accordingly in description.json. However, the information in the schemas cannot be used directly in Type Script. To do this, a Type Script interface must be defined manually in your own source code. Note: In old templates, modules Tc Hmi was used instead of namespace Tc Hmi. The resulting Java Script code is exactly the same. However, this syntax is outdated and is therefore no longer used in newer templates. The Type Script interface should be defined within the namespace area of the project name. namespace Tc Hmi. Controls { export namespace Framework Prj Datatype { export class Framework Prj1Control extends Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control { constructor(element: JQuery, pc Element: JQuery, attrs: Tc Hmi. Controls. Control Attribute List) { super(element, pc Element, attrs); // more here } } export interface plc Value { /** Count Down on rising edge */ Count Down: boolean; /** Load Start Value */ LOAD: boolean; /** Start Value */ PV: number; } } } Tc Hmi. Controls.register Ex('Framework Prj1Control', 'Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj Datatype', Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj Datatype. Framework Prj1Control); If the control still has the old module syntax, this can simply be changed. To do this, simply replace the keyword module with namespace. If you do not want to do this, a new namespace must be added in parallel to module of the project name. The Type Script interface can then be defined here. module Tc Hmi { export module Controls { export module Framework Prj Datatype Old { export class Framework Prj1Control extends Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control { // more here } } export namespace Framework Prj Datatype Old { export interface plc Value { /** Count Down on rising edge */ Count Down: boolean; /** Load Start Value */ LOAD: boolean; /** Start Value */ PV: number; } } register Ex('Framework Prj Ts Datatypes', 'Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj Datatype Old', Framework Prj Datatype Old. Framework Prj1Control); } } The data type is now known as Tc Hmi. Controls. Framework Prj Datatype.plc Value. As the control class is in the same scope, the type can be accessed with the identifier Framework Prj Datatype.plc Value . An attribute setter and process function [} 1564] can look like the following, for example: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1579
## Page 1580

Framework protected __value: Framework Prj Datatype.plc Value | undefined; public set Value(value New: Framework Prj Datatype.plc Value | null) { // convert the value with the value converter let converted Value = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Object<typeof value New>(value New); // check if the converted value is valid if (converted Value === null) { // if we have no value to set we have to fall back to the default Value Internal from description.json converted Value = this.get Attribute Default Value Internal('Value') as Framework Prj Datatype.plc Value; } if (tchmi_equal(converted Value, this.__value)) { // skip processing when the value has not changed return; } // remember the new value this.__value = converted Value; // inform the system that the function has a changed result. Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + '.on Property Changed', { property Name: 'Value' }); // call process function to process the new value this.__process Value(); } protected __process Value() { if (this.__value) { this.__value. Count Down; // known to Type Script this.__value. PV; // even tooltip "Start Value" is shown } } Custom control administration objects can be defined and used in the same way. 14.2.2.2.4.2 Handling of symbol expressions in objects A control setter can contain objects that contain symbol expressions. The control must enable this for each attribute individually via the property allow Symbol Expressions In Object [} 1546]. In this case this is shown in Visual Studio as follows: For this purpose, the source code that deals with attribute handling [} 1564] must be adapted accordingly. First an existing Object Resolver has to be located. If successful, this will be destroyed. Then a new Object Resolver with the new object (which may contain the symbol expression) is created and saved. At the same time a watch function is linked, which is called initially and when changes in referenced symbols occur. This watch function checks whether the control is currently visible. If this is not the case, the Object Resolver is put into a waiting state. If the control is made visible later, all Object Resolvers are reactivated by the system. If an error occurs, processing is aborted with an error message. Processing is terminated when the new value is identical to the old value. If the value is changed, the new value is saved, and the system is notified about the change and responds to it. Instead of the generic type object, a more specific Type Script type definition [} 1579] can be used. protected __value: object | undefined; /** * @description Setter function for 'data-tchmi-value' attribute. * @param value New the new value or null */ public set Value(value New: object | null): void { // convert the value with the value converter let converted Value = Tc Hmi. Value Converter.to Object<object>(value New); // check if the converted value is valid 1580 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1581

Framework if (converted Value === null) { // if we have no value to set we have to fall back to the default Value Internal from descript ion.json converted Value = this.get Attribute Default Value Internal('Value') as object; } let resolver Info = this.__object Resolvers.get('value'); if (resolver Info) { if (resolver Info.watch Destroyer) { resolver Info.watch Destroyer(); } resolver Info.resolver.destroy(); } let resolver = new Symbol. Object Resolver(converted Value); this.__object Resolvers.set('value', { resolver: resolver, watch Callback: this.__on Resolver For My Attribute Watch Callback, watch Destroyer: resolver.watch(this.__on Resolver For My Attribute Watch Callback) }); } /** * The watch callback for the value object resolver. */ protected __on Resolver For My Attribute Watch Callback = (data: Symbol. Object Resolver. IWatch Result Object< Transform[]>) => { if (this.__is Attached === false) { // While not attached attribute should only be processed once during initializing phase. this.__suspend Object Resolver('value'); } if (data.error !== Tc Hmi. Errors. NONE) { Tc Hmi. Log.error('[Source=Control, Module=Tc Hmi. Controls. System. Tc Hmi Control, Id=' + this.get Id() + ', Attribute=Value] Resolving symbols from object failed with error: ' + Tc Hmi. Log.build Messa ge(data.details)); return; } if (tchmi_equal(data.value, this.__value)) { return; } this.__value = data.value; Tc Hmi. Event Provider.raise(this.__id + '.on Property Changed', { property Name: 'Value' }); this.__process Value(); }; public __process Value() { // process actions with Value // ... } 14.2.2.2.4.3 Handling of control inheritance If several of your own controls require an identical part of the source code, it is advisable to put them on a common inheritance basis. In this way, common attributes could be implemented in a base class and then used in all derived controls. Each custom control can be seen in the context of inheritance. All controls are at least derived from the base control Tc Hmi Control. From this, each control inherits the basic functionality such as positioning (including Left [} 761], Top [} 762], Width [} 762], Height [} 763]) and the handling of the life cycle [} 1557]. Inheritance is defined in two places in a control. First in the base [} 1538] attribute in the metadata of description.json. This inheritance is also defined in the Type Script/Java Script source code in the Base framework [} 1559] of the control. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1581
## Page 1582

Framework Methods and properties within the source code are marked in Type Script either as public, protected or private. Public resources (public) can be used/accessed from any location. These are therefore part of the public interface (API) of a control. Protected resources (protected), on the other hand, are only intended for derived classes. In contrast, private resources (private) are really only accessible to the class itself. Please note that only the Template.html [} 1552] file of the respective class is used. If an inheritance base requires certain elements in the template, these elements must be applied. 14.2.2.2.4.4 Dynamic control generation Controls can create additional foreign controls and use them in their own context. This enables the system to respond to events of these child controls. Example using the Control Factory API In this example the API of the Control Factory is used. When the control is created, the child control is created and attached to its own representation. By defining the parent, the child control is embedded in its own life cycle, so that the child control is automatically managed at the same time. In addition, an event handler is registered to respond to events of the child control. Note that this event registry must be cleaned up in a dedicated Destroy action in order to fix a memory leak. See also Control life cycle [} 1557] protected __child On Pressed Destroy Event: Destroy Function | undefined; public __init() { super.__init(); let child Name = this.__id + '_start Action'; let my Button = Tc Hmi. Control Factory.create Ex<Tc Hmi. Controls. Beckhoff. Tc Hmi Button> ( 'Tc Hmi. Controls. Beckhoff. Tc Hmi Button', child Name, { 'data-tchmi-top': 25, 'data-tchmi-left': 250, 'data-tchmi-width': 200, 'data-tchmi-height': 50, 'data-tchmi-text': 'Start Action', 'data-tchmi-background-color': { 'color': 'rgba(55, 55, 55, 1)' }, 'data-tchmi-state-symbol': '%s%PLC1. MAIN.test Bool%/s%' // Binding a symbol to an attribute during control creation }, this // marks our control as the parent ); if (my Button) { // Append to our DOM. This will be detected by the framework and its .__attach function will be called automatically. this.__element.append(my Button.get Element()); this.__child On Pressed Destroy Event = Tc Hmi. Event Provider.register(child Name + '.on Pressed', () => { // do something }); // Binding a symbol to an attribute after control creation Binding.create Ex2('%s%PLC1. MAIN.another Bool%/s%', 'State Symbol', my Button); } } public destroy() { if (this.__keep Alive) { return; } if(this.__child On Pressed Destroy Event){ this.__child On Pressed Destroy Event(); } super.destroy(); } 1582 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1583

Framework Example of a child control embedded in the template Child controls can also be embedded directly in the Template [} 1552] of a control. The same syntax is used for this as is used in engineering to represent a control in code. The only difference is the {Id} placeholder, which is replaced by the actual ID when the control is compiled. It is mandatory to use the {Id} placeholder, otherwise it would be impossible to create more than one instance of the control. The compilation of the second instance would run into an error because it would try to create a control with a name already assigned. <div class="Tc Hmi_Controls_Example-template"> <div id="{Id}_start Action" data-tchmi-type="Tc Hmi. Controls. Beckhoff. Tc Hmi Button" data-tchmi-top="25" data-tchmi-left="250" data-tchmi-width="200" data-tchmi-height="50" data-tchmi-text="Start Action" data-tchmi-state-symbol="%s%PLC1. MAIN.test Bool%/s%" > <script data-tchmi-target-attribute="data-tchmi-background-color" type="application/json"> { "color": "rgba(55, 55, 55, 1)" } </script> </div> </div> The instance of the child control can then be accessed in __previnit or __init of the control: let button = Controls.get<Tc Hmi. Controls. Beckhoff. Button>(this.get Id() + '_start Action'); 14.2.2.3 Functions A function consists of the file containing the source code and a JSON file with corresponding metadata. These two files do not necessarily have to be created in a separate folder. Depending on the number of functions, it may be useful to group them together in a folder. A function can be created based on Type Script or Java Script. Both have the same technical options and are very similar in terms of programming. Due to the better Visual Studio programming support offered by Visual Studio, Type Script should be selected for new functions. To create a new function, right-click on the destination folder in the context menu and select Add new Item. A file for Type Script/Java Script is now created, along with a file containing the matching metadata. The files are identical to functions that can be created within an HMI project. We therefore refer to the documentation for these functions [} 1476] here. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1583
## Page 1584

Framework The metadata file must have a reference in Manifest.json [} 1532] within a framework package in order to be able to use it. 1584 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

Log in with this user on the configuration page of the server and reset the password of the user "__System Administrator". 2. Reset the server. How can I reset the server? To reset the server, perform the following steps: 1. Stop the server via the Sys Tray icon by clicking on "Shutdown". 2. Start the "Twin CAT HMI Server Factory reset" shortcut. Confirm the confirmation prompt with "Yes". The server starts up briefly and performs a reset. 3. Restart the Twin CAT HMI Server. The server is now reset. The password of the user "__System Administrator" must be initialized again. I cannot find the target server with the Discovery function in the Publish dialog. What can I do? This can have the following causes: 1. The password of the user "__System Administrator" was not initialized. For security reasons, the server cannot be found using the discovery function. ◦ Solution 1: Enter the IP address of the destination server under connection settings. Click "Validate Connection". In this case, the dialog for initializing the "__System Administrator" password in engineering opens. ◦ Solution 2: Initialize the user "__System Administrator" on the target server. 2. The password of the user "__System Administrator" has not been initialized and the server has been starting for more than five minutes. The server must be restarted for security reasons. ◦ Solution: Connect to the target system, restart the server and initialize the user "__System Administrator". 3. There are connection problems. Check the steps in the question below. 1590 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1591

FAQ I can't connect to my target server. What can I do? This can have the following causes: 1. There is no network connection to the system. ◦ Check the network connection to the system (e.g. using a ping command). 2. The system's firewall is blocking access. ◦ Check the firewall settings on the target system and enable the port on which the Twin CAT HMI Server is running (e.g. port 1010 for http or 1020 for https). 3. The port that you want to use to access the server has not been released in the server. ◦ Add Port on the configuration page of the server. How can I share an additional port on the server? How to share additional ports on the server can be found here. The server reports "License error". What can I do? The Twin CAT HMI Server can only be started if a valid license is available on the target system. Activate a license [} 26] on the target system. How can I start the Twin CAT HMI Server automatically? A recommendation on this topic can be found in the chapter Autostart Client [} 954]. With version 1.12 the Twin CAT HMI Server is automatically started with the system startup via the service Tc Hmi Srv. How can I start multiple instances of the Twin CAT HMI Server on one system? Since version 1.12, multiple server instances can be started on one system. This function is included in the basic TF2000 license. The target and client licenses are shared among the server instances, so you need licenses for the sum of all connected targets or clients. To start another server instance, proceed as follows: 1. Stop the service from the Twin CAT HMI Server (Tc Hmi Srv). You can do this in the Task Manager under the services: TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1591
## Page 1592

FAQ 2. Navigate to the following folder on the system hard disk: C:\Program Data\Beckhoff\TF2000 Twin CAT 3 HMI Server\service. 3. Create a new folder for the additional server instance. The folder name specifies the name of the instance. The default instance has the name "Tc Hmi Project". 4. Start the service again via the Task Manager. ð There are now multiple server instances initially running on the same port. Since this is not allowed, the ports must be changed. 5. Open the configuration page of the default server instance at Tc Hmi Srv - Web server and change the ports to free ports. 6. Confirm the changes by clicking Accept at the bottom of the page. 1592 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000
## Page 1593

FAQ 7. Change the name of the instance at Tc Hmi Srv - General and confirm the changes by clicking on Accept. Enter the name you used for the folder name here. 8. Repeat the procedure from steps 3 to 7 for additional server instances. ð The server instances are now accessible via different ports. In the future, a service management page will be provided in the Twin CAT HMI server which will make it easy to create further instances. 16.3 Client How can I access the HMI with a client? After you have published a project on the server, you can access the system from any client. Open a browser and enter the URL of the server. This usually consists of the IP address and the port number. • http: http://127.0.0.1:1010 • https: https://127.0.0.1:1020 How can I access the HMI from a mobile end device? You can access the HMI from mobile end devices in the same way as from desktop PCs. How can I establish an encrypted connection to a mobile end device? Some mobile browsers block connections with self-signed certificates. In this case, you can install the certificate on the device: 1. Export the self-signed certificate of the server. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1593
## Page 1594

FAQ 2. Transfer the certificate to the mobile device. You can, for example, send it to the device by email. 3. Install the certificate on the mobile end device (click on the certificate and follow the wizard). ð You can now access the HMI. If you do not want to install the certificate on the device and want to provide a general secure access from mobile end devices, you can issue an official certificate of a CA and import it into the server. Can I start the client automatically? The client can be started automatically. Some browsers also support starting in full screen mode. Information on this topic can be found in the Autostart Client [} 955] chapter. 16.4 Communication Which communication protocols does Twin CAT HMI support? The Twin CAT HMI supports communication via ADS to Twin CAT systems [} 1114] and communication via OPC UA to OPC UA servers [} 1131]. In addition, the Twin CAT HMI servers can exchange data with each other via server-to-server communication [} 1452]. A server extension [} 1457] offers further communication options. How do I use the ADS extension? You can configure the connection to Twin CAT systems in the ADS extension. You will find instructions on how to do this in the ADS chapter [} 1114]. The data points can then be used [} 109] in Twin CAT HMI. How do I use the OPC UA Client Extension? In the OPC UA Client Extension you can configure connections to OPC UA Servers. Instructions can be found in the chapter OPC UA Client [} 1131]. The data points can then be used [} 109] in Twin CAT HMI. How can I check the connection status to my target system? With the ADS extension and with the OPC UA client extension you can click on "Diagnosis" on the configuration page of the server [} 957]. There you can view the current connection status. I cannot establish a connection to my Twin CAT system. What can I do? Check whether a route to Twin CAT exists. The Twin CAT system must be in Run mode and the PLC must be started. I have transferred my project to the target server. Afterwards, no data points from the Twin CAT system are displayed. The data points were displayed on the engineering system. What could be the cause? The following causes are possible: 1. In the Twin CAT HMI Server, a distinction is made between local profiles and remote profiles [} 957]. With a project publish, [} 950] a remote profile (selected in the Publish dialog) is transferred to the target server. Check the connection settings of the ADS extension for the remote profile. 2. There are not enough target licenses on the target server. One target license is required per Twin CAT system. Activate [} 26] additional target licenses. I cannot transfer my project with OPC-UA-Client-Extension to the target system. What could be the cause? The OPC-UA-Client-Extension requires the license TF2110. Activate this license [} 26] on the target system and run the project publish [} 950] again. 1594 Version: 2.13.0 TE2000

FAQ Can a Twin CAT HMI server communicate with another Twin CAT HMI server? Twin CAT HMI servers can communicate with each other via server-to-server communication [} 1452]. 16.5 Framework How can I realize a page switching? Page switching can be implemented via the control Tc Hmi Region [} 830]. You will find instructions on how to do this in the chapter Creating Navigation [} 44]. Can I develop my own controls for the Twin CAT HMI? The development of user-specific controls in HTML5, Java Script and CSS 3 is possible via so-called "Framework Controls [} 1535]". How can I integrate a Framework Control into other Twin CAT HMI projects? A Framework Control can be exported as a package [} 1041] via Package Management and installed [} 1035] in other Twin CAT HMI projects. Is there a training for the development of Framework Controls? The one-day training course TR7060 can be attended for the development of Framework Controls. The dates can be found on our website. Can I integrate external libraries into the Twin CAT HMI? The Twin CAT HMI Framework offers an API that can be used to implement many functions. The integration of external web libraries is possible within a Framework Control [} 1535]. The external library must be integrated into the Framework Control project. In the Description.json [} 1536] a reference [} 1539] to the files of the library must be created. I have created a Framework Control. This is not displayed in the Twin CAT HMI Designer or in the Live View. What could be the cause? Java Script is an interpreted scripting language, therefore syntax errors etc. can only be detected at runtime. Such an error may result in the Control not being displayed in the Designer or Live View. The Developer Tools [} 1600] of the browsers offer a possibility for diagnosis. These developer tools also allow you to debug a control. TE2000 Version: 2.13.0 1595
