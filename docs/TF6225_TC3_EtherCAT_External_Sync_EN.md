Overview 2 Overview As a real-time software environment, Twin CAT offers the option of synchronization with an externally specified time, based on cycle/frequency or absolute time. Time access usually takes place via the Ether CAT fieldbus and the integrated distributed clocks functionality. The external time can be transferred to the Twin CAT system in different ways: Method Required devices IEEE 1588, PTP EL6688 Ether CAT Terminal Ether CAT <-> Ether CAT EL6692, EL6695 Ether CAT Terminal Any clock pulse as electrical signal EL1252 Ether CAT Terminal (as described in this document) Other methods: See Beckhoff Information System The Twin CAT 3 Ether CAT External Sync function extends the Twin CAT Ether CAT master with the option of synchronizing the Beckhoff real-time with an external digital electrical clock signal and provides a library with various function blocks for this purpose. The signal must be connected to an EL1252 Ether CAT Terminal, which means that the Ether CAT fieldbus has to be used. Ether CAT System Documentation For further information on external synchronization see the Beckhoff Information System, section Fieldbus Components > Ether CAT Terminals > Ether CAT System Documentation Application examples • An existing system is to be expanded with an additional Beckhoff Twin CAT controller, which should be synchronized with the main controller. At the main controller, the clock signal that is picked up by the Twin CAT controller via the EL1252 can be generated by a toggling 24 V digital output, for example. (See Examples > Ether CAT External Sync [} 17]) • A Twin CAT system should generally run synchronously with an external cycle, e.g. a second pulse (PPS, pulses per second) or local time • A Twin CAT system is to be supplied with the absolute time, in addition to the clock pulse. If an absolute time is also modulated onto an external PPS signal, e.g. via DCF77 coding, the TF6225 can be used in conjunction with a PLC function block to decode the DCF77 signal. The function blocks for coding/ decoding DCF77 are included in the sample program. Other time codings can be implemented in the PLC itself. (See Examples > DCF77 [} 21]) Application example: external synchronization of a system environment (B) from a non-modifiable system environment (A) In the following sections, system environment (A) is regarded as the master system (from any manufacturer), system environment (B) is regarded as the slave system (Twin CAT only).

Technical introduction 4 Technical introduction When external synchronization is applied, two system times meet: 1. The controlled/time-receiving Twin CAT system with its distributed clocks. 2. The time-sending system with its encoder clock. Synchronization process: • Two timestamps (one external and one internal) must be transferred periodically to the time-receiving Twin CAT system. • To form a timestamp pair, the value of both times is recorded at the same time. The "internal clock" is always based on the system's own distributed clock time. The "external clock" is the time from the external, time-giving system. • The timestamp pairs are determined periodically, e.g. every 100 ms. • If these timestamp pairs are repeatedly sent to the receiving Twin CAT real-time system, the system is able to determine the deviation trend and can readjust itself until clock synchronization is achieved. The remaining offset is offered for linking through variables in the Ether CAT IO tree. Essentially, Twin CAT synchronization is not designed to minimize or compensate the offset. If the initial difference between the two systems is large (weeks, months), this would mean a very long waiting time. The readjusting Twin CAT system therefore establishes clock synchronization within a few seconds and maintains the offset. Offset step changes can occur if: • The real-time behavior no longer permits tracking. • Leap seconds/time changes etc. are received via the external time. The readjusted control should be designed in such a way that it can cope with offset step changes. The quality of the time control that can be achieved depends, among other things, on how accurately the external clock can be read and how the "new signal" event can be fed into the time-receiving system. The jitter-free nature of this external timestamp must be magnitudes better than the intended control objective. Example: The jitter associated with the edge output of commercially available direct DCF77 receivers (German radio time on longwave) can be such that the readjustment is disturbed up to the ms range, even taking into account the missing 59th second. This leads to step changes in the offset display. TF6225 Version: 1.2.0 13

PLC API 5 PLC API 5.1 Function blocks 5.1.1 FB_Ec Ext Sync Ext Times The function block FB_Ec Ext Sync Ext Times enables or disables the synchronization of the internal and external clocks. The function block FB_Ec Ext Sync Is Synchronized [} 15] can be used to check synchronization. This function block is required for the synchronization. • It enables or disables the synchronization of the internal and external clocks. • It periodically sends the timestamp pair n Ext Time and n Int Time to the Twin CAT real-time system via ADS. The function block should be called at most every 2-5 ms. A new/fresh timestamp pair should be assigned to the function block every time it is called, otherwise the call is meaningless. The frequency of the function block call influences the quality of the time control. The more often the function block is called, the better the readjusted system can work. If the timestamp quality is good, one call per second, e.g. through a PPS signal (Pulse Per Second), may be sufficient.

Select a destination directory for saving the project and confirm the dialog with Select folder. ð The Tc3_Ether CATExt Sync Sample solution is loaded. Further information on the general procedure for commissioning the PLC or starting the program can be found in the terminal documentation and in the Ether CAT System Documentation. 6.1.1 Configuration Sample configuration for TF6225 TC3 Ether CAT External Sync The operating principle of the TF6225 can be illustrated through the configuration of two independent IPC systems. The diagram shows the hardware structure of the master system (clock generator) on the left and the slave system (clock receiver) on the right. TF6225 Version: 1.2.0 17
## Page 18

Examples Recording of the internal and external clock with an oscilloscope After commissioning the system, you can monitor the synchronization via the Twin CAT 3 Scope View, for example. You can also use an oscilloscope to record the internal and external clocks on a time base. To do this, add an EL2202-0100 Ether CAT Terminal to the slave system. The external clock of the master system can be recorded via the input of the EL1252 Ether CAT Terminal and can serve as a reference (trigger), for example. The internal clock of the slave system can be output via a toggling bit at the additionally connected EL2202-0100 Ether CAT Terminal. If external synchronization is not active, the time drift can be recognized by the fact that the two signals are not fixed in time relative to each other. 18 Version: 1.2.0 TF6225
## Page 19

Examples The EL2202-0100 Ether CAT Terminal is the extended distributed clocks version of the EL2202. It can be obtained from Beckhoff, or it may be possible to set it up by reprogramming the EL2202. Further information can be found in the documentation EL2202, EL2252 – two- channel digital output terminal. Ether CAT master configuration of the slave system for external DC synchronization via the EL1252 in Twin CAT 3 Engineering The Ether CAT master of the slave system for external synchronization can be configured in Twin CAT 3 Engineering under advanced device settings. To open the advanced settings, double-click on the Ether CAT device in the Twin CAT project tree. Select the Ether CAT tab and click Advanced Settings… Select the Distributed Clocks entry in the navigation tree in the dialog that opens. Configure the Ether CAT master of the slave system according to the following diagram. 6.1.2 Notes Notes on the sample program of the slave system • The sample program shows the slave system (system environment B). This requires a controller with an EL1252 Ether CAT Terminal. You can either use an Embedded PC, to which the terminal is connected on the right-hand side, or an IPC with an Ether CAT connection, e.g. an RJ-45 connection to the EK1100 Coupler with the terminal. (See also Configuration [} 17]) • If necessary, read in the I/O configuration again and link the variables as follows: ◦ n Int Time → EL1252, PDO: Latch/ Latch Pos1 ◦ a Ec Master Ams Net Id → device (Ether CAT), PDO: Info Data/ Ams Net Id ◦ b Out → (optional) EL2202-0100, PDO: Channel 1/ output TF6225 Version: 1.2.0 19
## Page 20

Examples • In the sample program, the internal time value (n Ext Time) is incremented according to the expected input signal (50 ms period → r Event Time Step = 5·107) when an incoming positive edge event is detected at the EL1252 input. Select the appropriate value for r Event Time Step, depending on the expected cycle duration: n Ext Time := n Ext Time + LREAL_TO_ULINT(r Event Time Step); The addition of a constant time value to a base time value for the time stamp of the external time depends on an incoming (positive) edge. This causes an external time stamp to be mapped by the external clock. An edge is always determined by comparing the current internal time stamp supplied by the EL1252 with the last time stamp in each task run: IF(current_int Time Satmp<>last_int Time Satmp) THEN • Optionally, you can add a YT-Scope-View to visualize the project and record the following variables from the MAIN program: ◦ n Dc Offset (the result of FB_Ec Ext Sync Is Synchronized from n Ext Time and n Int Time) ◦ b Ext Time_Digits and b Int Time_Digits for visualizing the temporal drift or synchronous operation after activation of the synchronization process ◦ b Synchronized to show that the synchronization has taken place • The variable b Enable Ext Sync can be set to TRUE at a desired time. General information on the master system • The master system is not included in this sample. In principle, any timer that can provide a 24 V square wave signal could be used as a master system. The master system shown in the diagram has enabled distributed clocks (DC) for the EL2202-0100 Ether CAT Terminal and set a corresponding task cycle time of 25 ms for an output signal with T = 50 ms. The following code line in the (POU) MAIN is used for generating the output signal: b Out := NOT b Out; • The Ether CAT master of the master system has distributed clocks (DC) enabled. Further information regarding the setting can be found in the Ether CAT System Documentation in the Setup section under Twin CAT System Manager > Notes on Distributed Clocks. An EL2202-0100 Ether CAT Terminal in the master system acts as DC timer and also issues the output signal. • Larger cycle durations, e.g. 1 s, can be converted using a counter variable. 6.1.3 Results Scope View recording After the activation of the external synchronization on the part of the slave system (TRUE => b Enable Ext Sync), the deviation between the internal and external time values (n Dc Offset), the synchronization window n Sync Window and the actual synchronization is recorded with Scope View (b Synchronized): 20 Version: 1.2.0 TF6225
