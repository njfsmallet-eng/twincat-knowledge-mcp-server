Configuration 4 Configuration 4.1 Overview The server can receive Modbus functions via TCP/IP. Modbus areas According to the Modbus specification, the following four Modbus areas are defined: Modbus areas Data type Access Application example Digital inputs (discrete inputs) 1 bit Read only Digital outputs (coils) 1 bit Read and write Input register 16 bit Read only Output register 16 bit Read and write After installation, the Modbus areas are mapped to the memory areas of the PLC. The default setting of the Modbus TCP server can be found in the article on default mapping [} 19]. The default setting can be adjusted using the configuration file Tc Modbus Srv.xml or the configurator [} 17]. ADS access To ensure that the specified Modbus areas can be accessed via ADS, please add the following global variables to your PLC project. VAR_GLOBAL mb_Input_Coils : ARRAY [0..255] OF BOOL; mb_Output_Coils : ARRAY [0..255] OF BOOL; mb_Input_Registers : ARRAY [0..255] OF WORD; mb_Output_Registers : ARRAY [0..255] OF WORD; END_VAR Prerequisites Development environment Target platform PLC libraries to include Twin CAT v3.0.0 PC or CX (x86) Tc2_Modbus Srv 4.2 Twin CAT Modbus TCP Configurator The configurator is installed per default to the directory \Twin CAT3\Functions\TF6250-Modbus-TCP. The tools allow to read and change the actual configuration of Twin CAT Modbus TCP server. TF6250 Version: 1.6.4 17
