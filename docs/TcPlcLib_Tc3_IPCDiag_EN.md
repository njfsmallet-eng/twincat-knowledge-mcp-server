Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

Introduction 2 Introduction The Twin CAT 3 PLC library Tc3_IPCDiag is used for the IPC diagnostics of Beckhoff IPCs. The desired IPC diagnostic parameters are selected via an enumeration (E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key [} 20]). Specify this enumeration as an input at the function blocks of the library. Details of the possible diagnosis and the parameters can also be found in the documentation on the Beckhoff Device Manager.

Function blocks 3 Function blocks The PLC library Tc3_IPCDiag provides function blocks for reading and setting IPC diagnostic parameters. The available parameters are listed in the enumeration E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key [} 20]. The IPC diagnostic modules available on the IPC must be registered before a parameter can be accessed. The function block FB_IPCDiag_Register [} 15] is used for this. This function block doesn't need to be called again afterwards. All function blocks are called by a positive edge on the b Execute input. Afterwards, cyclic calling of the function block (b Execute = FALSE) returns the result of the query at the output as soon as the processing of the query has been completed (b Busy = FALSE). Each function block must be called (b Execute = FALSE) for as long as it takes for the internal processing (b Busy = FALSE) to be completed. During that time, leave all inputs of the function block unchanged. Reading parameters Parameters are read with the function block FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter [} 9]. If the function block body is called, the parameter is read from the entire system into the PLC. Parameters that could exist several times (e.g. IP addresses) are all read in one call. This takes place asynchronously, therefore the function block body has to be called until the procedure is complete and valid parameter values are available. The parameter is then assigned to a PLC variable using its Get Parameter() method. Parameters that exist several times can be assigned to an array at once (with Get Parameter() or Get Parameter Strings()) or individually in a targeted way (with Get Parameter By Idx()). The function block FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter Periodic [} 11] is available if the periodic reading of a parameter is desired. Setting parameters Parameters are written with the function block FB_IPCDiag_Write Parameter [} 14]. If the function block body is called, the parameter is written from the PLC into the entire system. This similarly asynchronous call sets a single parameter at a time. For parameters that potentially exist several times, the desired parameter must be explicitly selected via the function block inputs. See the Samples [} 85] for further programming information. Restricted access at the time of system start MDP forms an interface to the hardware. This is independent of Twin CAT. MDP can be accessed from Twin CAT with the PLC library. This is done internally by means of ADS communication. The versatility of the hardware configuration justifies a different initialization phase of the MDP service. It is possible that first PLC cycles are executed while the MDP initialization is not yet completed. Either the possible error outputs as well as timeouts of the function blocks from the library can be reacted and a new query can be triggered or the queries are executed deliberately delayed after the system start. It is recommended in the PLC program not to query values from the MDP immediately after the system start, but to consider a small waiting time. How large this should be depends on various parameters (such as the performance of your control computer), and can therefore not be given as a general rule. Typically it is in the range of 10-60 seconds. 3.1 FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter The function block allows an IPC diagnostic parameter to be queried. The desired parameter is selected from the enumeration E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key [} 20]. Some parameters may exist several times. In this case, the function block reads all existing values at once and these values can be copied individually or all at once using the Get Parameter() methods. TE1000 Version: 1.4.1 9

## Page 10

Function blocks The parameters are subdivided into groups. Some of these groups correspond to the modules of the 'Configuration Area' in the MDP. Modules may be instanced several times. Accordingly, a parameter of a multi-instanced module exists several times or has a correspondingly large number of values. On the other hand, there are list parameters whose identifier already makes this clear. According to the number of list entries, the parameter also exists here several times or has several values. VAR_INPUT VAR_INPUT b Execute : BOOL; e Parameter Key : E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key; n Module Idx : USINT := 0; (* optional module selection for parameters of configuration area ; 0:all corresponding modules are read (or rather the first module is read in case of list parameter s) *) t Timeout : TIME := DEFAULT_ADS_TIMEOUT; (* ADS communication timeout *) s Net Id : T_Ams Net Id := ''; (* keep empty '' for the local device *) END_VAR VAR_IN_OUT CONSTANT fb Register : FB_IPCDiag_Register; END_VAR b Execute: The function block is called by a positive edge on the input b Execute, if the function block is not already active. e Parameter Key: The parameter to be queried is selected at this input as an enumeration value of the type E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key [} 20]. If the parameter is a list parameter, the complete list is read at once and made available. n Module Idx: The module index can optionally be specified at this input if the parameter belongs to a module that exists several times. If the parameter belongs to a multi-existent module and the input n Module Idx is left at 0, then the parameter values of all module instances are read. If the parameter is a list parameter, however, then only one module instance can be read. t Timeout: Specifies a maximum time to execute the internal ADS communication. s Net Id: To execute the query on the local device, it is not necessary to specify this input variable. Alternatively, an empty string can be specified. To direct the query to another computer, its AMS Net Id (of type T_Ams Net Id) can be specified here. fb Register: The instance of FB_IPCDiag_Register [} 15] must be transferred so that the function block can use the available information for the IPC diagnostic configuration on the target system. This instance must have been called beforehand. Otherwise an error is output. VAR_OUTPUT VAR_OUTPUT b Valid : BOOL; (* read data available (equal IF NOT b Busy AND NOT b Error) *) b Busy : BOOL; b Error : BOOL; hr Error Code : HRESULT; ip Error Message : I_Tc Message; n Read Parameter Values : USINT; (* number of read parameter values *) n Module Count : USINT; (* number of module instances (configuration area) with the dem anded parameter *) END_VAR b Valid: This output is TRUE if both b Busy and b Error are FALSE. b Busy: This output is TRUE as long as the function block is active. b Error: Becomes TRUE as soon as an error situation occurs. hr Error Code: Returns an error code [} 23] if the b Error output is set. ip Error Message: Returns detailed information if a b Error output is set. The interface pointer used here is always valid (not equal to zero) and is of the type I_Tc Message. In particular, the corresponding error is immediately visible as plain text in the PLC Online View. 10 Version: 1.4.1 TE1000

Function blocks n Read Parameter Values: This output indicates the number of parameter values read. In the case of list parameters, therefore, all list entries are always read automatically and made available. n Module Count: This output indicates the number of module instances that contain the selected parameter. The parameter must originate from the MDP Configuration Area for this. Otherwise, n Module Count=0. Methods After the reading procedure has been successfully completed, the parameter can be copied using one of the following methods. Get Parameter() : METHOD Get Parameter : HRESULT VAR_INPUT p Buffer : PVOID; // buffer for parameter with a given size of n Parameter Size n Buffer Size : UDINT; // buffer size in bytes (for one or more values) END_VAR The Get Parameter() method provides easy access to the read parameter. All values are available if the parameter existed several times. In that case, all values are copied at once or, as the case may be, as many values are copied as the specified buffer size can contain. Hence, an ARRAY of the corresponding data type can be used to obtain a complete list. This is not possible with parameters of the type STRING on account of the different length. If a parameter of the type STRING exists several times, or if a list parameter of the type STRING exists, then a different method must be used to read the other values. Get Parameter By Idx() : METHOD Get Parameter By Idx : HRESULT VAR_INPUT p Buffer : PVOID; // buffer for parameter with a given size of n Parameter Size n Buffer Size : UDINT; // buffer size in bytes (for one or more values) n Parameter Idx : USINT(1..255); // selection of parameter value (1..n Read Parameter Values) END_VAR This function is required if the parameter was present several times and individual values are to be copied. The input n Parameter Idx specifies which parameter value is to be copied. If it is a list parameter, specify the desired list index there. Specify the module index if it is not a list parameter, but a parameter that had several module instances. Both indices begin with 1. Get Parameter Strings() : METHOD Get Parameter Strings : HRESULT VAR_INPUT p Buffer : PVOID; // buffer for parameter with a given size of n Parameter Size n Buffer Size : UDINT; // buffer size in bytes (for one or more values) n Strings : USINT; // number of strings to be copied (each string with size=n Buffer Size/ n Strings) END_VAR If the parameter existed several times and represents a character string (STRING) in terms of the data type, this method can be used to copy several character strings at the same time. The input n Strings specifies how many character strings are to be copied. An 'ARRAY[1..n Strings] OF STRING' can serve as a buffer.

## Page 12

Function blocks The functionality is analogous to the function block FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter [} 9], where the parameter is queried once. For FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter Periodic, the parameter is permanently queried with a regularity defined by t Period. Some parameters may exist several times. In this case, the function block reads all existing values at once and these values can be copied individually or all at once using the Get Parameter() methods. The parameters are subdivided into groups. Some of these groups correspond to the modules of the 'Configuration Area' in the MDP. Modules may be instanced several times. Accordingly, a parameter of a multi-instanced module exists several times or has a correspondingly large number of values. On the other hand, there are list parameters whose identifier already makes this clear. According to the number of list entries, the parameter also exists here several times or has several values. VAR_INPUT VAR_INPUT b Execute : BOOL; e Parameter Key : E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key; n Module Idx : USINT := 0; (* optional module selection for parameters of configuration area ; 0:all corresponding modules are read (or rather the first module is read in case of list parameter s) *) t Period : TIME := T#60S; (* set t Period >= t Timeout for periodical reading (set 0 for direct execution) *) t Timeout : TIME := DEFAULT_ADS_TIMEOUT; (* ADS communication timeout *) s Net Id : T_Ams Net Id := ''; (* keep empty '' for the local device *) END_VAR VAR_IN_OUT CONSTANT fb Register : FB_IPCDiag_Register; END_VAR b Execute: The function block is called by a positive edge on the input b Execute, if the function block is not already active. e Parameter Key: The parameter to be queried is selected at this input as an enumeration value of the type E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key [} 20]. If the parameter is a list parameter, the complete list is read at once and made available. n Module Idx: The module index can optionally be specified at this input if the parameter belongs to a module that exists several times. If the parameter belongs to a multi-existent module and the input n Module Idx is left at 0, then the parameter values of all module instances are read. If the parameter is a list parameter, however, then only one module instance can be read. t Period: Specifies the regularity with which the parameter is to be queried. t Period must be greater than or equal to t Timeout. t Timeout: Specifies a maximum time to execute the internal ADS communication. s Net Id: To execute the query on the local device, it is not necessary to specify this input variable. Alternatively, an empty string can be specified. To direct the query to another computer, its AMS Net Id (of type T_Ams Net Id) can be specified here. fb Register: The instance of FB_IPCDiag_Register [} 15] must be transferred so that the function block can use the available information for the IPC diagnostic configuration on the target system. This instance must have been called beforehand. Otherwise an error is output. VAR_OUTPUT VAR_OUTPUT b Valid : BOOL; (* read data available (equal IF NOT b Busy AND NOT b Error) *) b Error : BOOL; hr Error Code : HRESULT; ip Error Message : I_Tc Message; n Read Parameter Values : USINT; (* number of read parameter values *) n Module Count : USINT; (* number of module instances (configuration area) with the dem anded parameter *) END_VAR b Valid: This output is TRUE if a parameter query takes place and b Error is FALSE. 12 Version: 1.4.1 TE1000

Function blocks b Error: Becomes TRUE as soon as an error situation occurs. hr Error Code: Returns an error code [} 23] if the b Error output is set. ip Error Message: Returns detailed information if a b Error output is set. The interface pointer used here is always valid (not equal to zero) and is of the type I_Tc Message. In particular, the corresponding error is immediately visible as plain text in the PLC Online View. n Read Parameter Values: This output indicates the number of parameter values read. In the case of list parameters, therefore, all list entries are always read automatically and made available. n Module Count: This output indicates the number of module instances that contain the selected parameter. The parameter must originate from the MDP Configuration Area for this. Otherwise, n Module Count=0. Methods After the reading procedure has been successfully completed, the parameter can be copied using one of the following methods. Get Parameter() : METHOD Get Parameter : HRESULT VAR_INPUT p Buffer : PVOID; // buffer for parameter with a given size of n Parameter Size n Buffer Size : UDINT; // buffer size in bytes (for one or more values) END_VAR The Get Parameter() method provides easy access to the read parameter. All values are available if the parameter existed several times. In that case, all values are copied at once or, as the case may be, as many values are copied as the specified buffer size can contain. Hence, an ARRAY of the corresponding data type can be used to obtain a complete list. This is not possible with parameters of the type STRING on account of the different length. If a parameter of the type STRING exists several times, or if a list parameter of the type STRING exists, then a different method must be used to read the other values. Get Parameter By Idx() : METHOD Get Parameter By Idx : HRESULT VAR_INPUT p Buffer : PVOID; // buffer for parameter with a given size of n Parameter Size n Buffer Size : UDINT; // buffer size in bytes (for one or more values) n Parameter Idx : USINT(1..255); // selection of parameter value (1..n Read Parameter Values) END_VAR This function is required if the parameter was present several times and individual values are to be copied. The input n Parameter Idx specifies which parameter value is to be copied. If it is a list parameter, specify the desired list index there. Specify the module index if it is not a list parameter, but a parameter that had several module instances. Both indices begin with 1. Get Parameter Strings() : METHOD Get Parameter Strings : HRESULT VAR_INPUT p Buffer : PVOID; // buffer for parameter with a given size of n Parameter Size n Buffer Size : UDINT; // buffer size in bytes (for one or more values) n Strings : USINT; // number of strings to be copied (each string with size=n Buffer Size/ n Strings) END_VAR If the parameter existed several times and represents a character string (STRING) in terms of the data type, this method can be used to copy several character strings at the same time. The input n Strings specifies how many character strings are to be copied. An 'ARRAY[1..n Strings] OF STRING' can serve as a buffer.

Function blocks 3.3 FB_IPCDiag_Write Parameter The function block allows an IPC diagnostic parameter to be written. The desired parameter is selected from the enumeration E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key [} 20]. Some parameters may generally exist several times. However, the inputs of the function block must be used to explicitly define which individual parameters are to be written.

The data to be transmitted must be stored there. n Buffer Size: The length of the data buffer in bytes is specified at this input. n Module Idx: If there are several module instances that contain the parameter, the desired module instance must be selected here. The module index begins with 1. n List Idx: The list item must be selected here if the parameter is a list parameter. The list index begins with 1. t Timeout: Specifies a maximum length of time for the execution of the function block. s Net Id: To execute the query on the local device, it is not necessary to specify this input variable. Alternatively, an empty string can be specified. To direct the query to another computer, its AMS Net Id (of type T_Ams Net Id) can be specified here. fb Register: The instance of FB_IPCDiag_Register [} 15] must be transferred so that the function block can use the available information for the IPC diagnostic configuration on the target system.

Function blocks Requirements Development environment Target platform PLC libraries to include Twin CAT v3.1.4024.7 IPC or CX (x86, x64, ARM) Tc3_IPCDiag 3.4 FB_IPCDiag_Register The function block checks which IPC diagnostic parameters are available and creates a register for this purpose. Specifically, a list of all available parameter modules is created. The function block only needs to determine this once, typically at the start of the program. If diagnostic parameters of a remote system are to be queried by means of a non-local AMS Net Id, the function block must be executed after its start. The instance of FB_IPCDiag_Register must be transferred to other function blocks from the library such as FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter [} 9] in order to obtain information about the determined register. VAR_INPUT VAR_INPUT b Execute : BOOL; t Timeout : TIME := DEFAULT_ADS_TIMEOUT; (* States the time before the function is cancelled . *) s Net Id : T_Ams Net Id := ''; (* keep empty '' for the local device *) END_VAR b Execute: The function block is called by a positive edge on the input b Execute, if the function block is not already active. t Timeout: Specifies a maximum length of time for the execution of the function block. s Net Id: To execute the query on the local device, it is not necessary to specify this input variable. Alternatively, an empty string can be specified. To direct the query to another computer, its AMS Net Id (of type T_Ams Net Id) can be specified here.

Function blocks 3.5 Access by index specification 3.5.1 FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter By Mdp Idx In individual cases, this function block can be used as an alternative to the simpler FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter [} 9] in order to query any desired parameters of the IPC diagnostics. The MDP (Modular Device Profile) information model lists all parameters with the help of areas, modules and tables. As the generic access to each parameter, an addressing is defined whose main component is the MDP index (2 bytes). Details can be found in the documentation on the Beckhoff Device Manager. VAR_INPUT VAR_INPUT b Execute : BOOL; n Index : WORD; (* F_IPCDiag_Get Mdp Index should be used if parameter is out of configu ration area *) n Flags : BYTE; n Sub Index : BYTE; p Buffer : PVOID; (* Contains the address of the buffer for the received data. *) n Buffer Size : UDINT; (* Contains the max. number of bytes to be received. *) t Timeout : TIME := DEFAULT_ADS_TIMEOUT; (* States the time before the function is cancell ed. *) s Net Id : T_Ams Net Id := ''; (* keep empty '' for the local device *) END_VAR b Execute: The function block is called by a positive edge on the input b Execute, if the function block is not already active. n Index: At this input the first part of the addressing for the required IPC diagnostic data is specified. If the desired parameter originates from the MDP Configuration Area, the MDP index contains the dynamically generated module ID. In this case it is recommended to use the F_IPCDiag_Get Mdp Idx() [} 18] function. n Flags: At this input the second part of the addressing for the required IPC diagnostic data is specified. n Sub Index: At this input the third part of the addressing for the required IPC diagnostic data is specified. The subindex also corresponds to the table row in the MDP information model. p Buffer: The memory address of the data buffer is specified at this input. The received data are stored there if the query is successful. n Buffer Size: The length of the data buffer in bytes is specified at this input. t Timeout: Specifies a maximum length of time for the execution of the function block. s Net Id: To execute the query on the local device, it is not necessary to specify this input variable. Alternatively, an empty string can be specified. To direct the query to another computer, its AMS Net Id (of type T_Ams Net Id) can be specified here. VAR_OUTPUT VAR_OUTPUT b Valid : BOOL; b Busy : BOOL; b Error : BOOL; hr Error Code : HRESULT; ip Error Message : I_Tc Message; n Count : UDINT; (* returns the number of bytes received *) END_VAR b Valid: This output is TRUE if both b Busy and b Error are FALSE. b Busy: This output is TRUE as long as the function block is active. b Error: Becomes TRUE as soon as an error situation occurs. 16 Version: 1.4.1 TE1000

As the generic access to each parameter, an addressing is defined whose main component is the MDP index (2 bytes). Details can be found in the documentation on the Beckhoff Device Manager. The function returns the MDP index for parameters from the MDP Configuration Area in order to enable parameter access via the MDP index (FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter By Mdp Idx [} 16]). Selection can be made by means of n Module Idx if several instances of the module type exist. Internally, the function determines the dynamic module ID and appends it to the MDP index.

At this input is the IPC diagnostics module type is specified. The possible types are listed in the enumeration E_IPCDiag_Module Type [} 20]. (Overview of the module types) n Module Idx. Because there can be several instances of a module type in the system, the module index beginning with 1 is specified at this input. n Table ID: The table ID in which the parameter exists is specified at this input. fb Register: The instance of FB_IPCDiag_Register [} 15] must be transferred so that the function can use the available information for the IPC diagnostic configuration on the target system. This instance must have been called beforehand. Otherwise an error is output. Return value The function returns the determined MDP index. In the event of an error, if the requested module is not available, the function returns a value of 0. 18 Version: 1.4.1 TE1000

Data types 4 Data types 4.1 E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key This enumeration lists all parameters of the IPC diagnostics that can be read and, in some cases, written in a simple way with the function blocks from the library. Below is an excerpt from the enumeration containing more than 150 parameters: Enumeration value Comment E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key. IPCDevice Name IPC device name, STRING, read/write (MDP general area) E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key. CPU_Usage CPU usage (%), UINT, read-only E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key. CPU_Temp CPU temperature (°C), INT, read-only E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key. Fan_Speed Fan speed (rpm), INT, read-only E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key. NIC_IPv4Address IPv4 address, STRING, read/write E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key. TC_Version Build Twin CAT build version, UINT, read-only Some parameters may exist several times. In this case, the function block FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter [} 9] reads all existing values at once and these values can be copied individually or all at once using the Get Parameter() methods. The parameters are subdivided into groups. Some of these groups correspond to the modules of the 'Configuration Area' in the MDP. Modules may be instanced several times. Accordingly, a parameter of a multi-instanced module exists several times or has a correspondingly large number of values. On the other hand, there are list parameters whose identifier already makes this clear. According to the number of list entries, the parameter also exists here several times or has several values. The comment for each enumeration entry contains the access possibility (e.g.: read-only) and the data types of the parameter value. Not every parameter is available on every system. Hardware and software may differ and reflect the availability of the parameters accordingly. For further information on the individual parameters, please refer to the documentation on the Beckhoff Device Manager. Extensions The parameters available herewith are continuously supplemented. It is recommended to use the latest version of the PLC library in order to take advantage of the full range of functions. 4.2 E_IPCDiag_Module Type The enumeration defines constant values for the different module types in the MDP (Modular Device Profile). A module type can occur several times per device. Hence, a device with two Ethernet interfaces also has two NIC modules.

Modules are parts of the MDP (Modular Device Profile) and contain diagnostic parameters that are hereby grouped. Each module list is valid for one target system, which is specified via the AMS Net Id.

Samples 7 Samples The following samples provide a quick introduction to the use of the PLC library, based on possible use cases. Further programming samples for IPC diagnostics using other programming languages can be found in the documentation on the Beckhoff Device Manager. 7.1 Ipc Diagnostics The sample shows the simple reading of various IPC diagnostics parameters with the help of the function blocks FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter [} 9] and FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter Periodic [} 11]. Six parameters are read once only and one parameter whose values change over time is read periodically. Variables are created for these parameters.

NIC_DHCP ]; fb Diag Read Periodic : FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter Periodic := (e Parameter Key:=E_IPCDiag_Parameter Key. e CPU_Temp, t Period:= T#10S, s Net Id:=c Net Id); END_VAR Each parameter is read as follows: The instance of FB_IPCDiag_Read Parameter is triggered and called cyclically until the reading procedure is completed. Following that, the parameter is copied using the Get Parameter() method to its own variable, which has been prepared for the purpose. E_State. Read Once: // reads every parameter once IF NOT fb Diag Read.b Busy THEN fb Diag Read(b Execute:= TRUE, e Parameter Key:=a Parameter Keys[n Key Idx], fb Register:=fb Diag Regist er); ELSE fb Diag Read(b Execute:= FALSE, fb Register:=fb Diag Register); END_IF IF NOT fb Diag Read.b Busy THEN IF fb Diag Read.b Error THEN e State := E_State.
