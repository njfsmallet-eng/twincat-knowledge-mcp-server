Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

Introduction 2 Introduction The maintenance or extension of the control code of machines already located in the field is a central use case that must be provided for by the machine controller development environments. It is particularly important to be able to generate compatible configurations or compatible control code for the respective target system – even after several years. The challenge here lies in the fact that the development environment is usually much newer than the target system. The Twin CAT3 Remote Manager enables the handling of various versions of the Twin CAT 3 development environment on the same computer. 8 Version: 1.2.1 TE1000

Twin CAT integration 3 Twin CAT integration This section describes the settings that have been specially added for the Remote Manager functionality in Twin CAT. Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar Use the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar to manually select the used Twin CAT version. This lists all installed Twin CAT 3 versions that can be loaded to the opened Visual Studio Shell. Remote Manager versions can be installed later. You can find them in the download area of our homepage. Open from Target To load a project from the target system, use the option Open Project From Target… from the menu File- >Open. After selecting this menu item, the project is downloaded from the target system, unpacked and subsequently opened in the Twin CAT version with which the project was last activated on the target system. In older Twin CAT 3.1.4020 versions the Twin CAT version of the target is used to open the project. Setting the Twin CAT default version So as not to open the wrong version of the Twin CAT 3 development environment by mistake, you can set the entry Twin CAT Version default in the Twin CAT options Twin CAT -> XAE Environment -> General to the value that is to be used as standard. TE1000 Version: 1.2.1 9

Twin CAT integration Project setting: Pin Version To set the version with which a project is to be opened, you can use the option Pin Version on the General tab of the Twin CAT project node. If this option is activated, the Twin CAT 3 version set in the project will be used automatically when double-clicking on the project file. 10 Version: 1.2.1 TE1000

Applications 4 Applications Selection of a Twin CAT 3 version before loading a project If the Twin CAT version is to be set before loading a project, proceed as follows: 1. Open the Visual Studio Shell. 2. Select the Twin CAT 3 version to be loaded in the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar. ð Once the Twin CAT 3 components have been completely loaded, this will be indicated in the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar by the text "Loaded" after the loaded Twin CAT 3 version. 3. Open the project via the dialog File -> Open -> Project folder. ð The project is now open in the selected Twin CAT 3 version. Opening the Twin CAT 3 version with which a project was saved If a Twin CAT 3 project is to be opened in the version in which it was saved, there are two options. Case 1: the Twin CAT 3 version is fixed (pinned) in the project. This means that not only the version with which the project was last edited and saved is stored in the project file, but also a flag indicating that this project should only be edited with precisely that version. Proceed as follows to open the project: 1. Double-click on the Twin CAT 3 project file. ð If the Twin CAT 3 version pinned in the project is installed, the project will be opened with precisely this version. TE1000 Version: 1.2.1 11

## Page 12

Applications ð If the Twin CAT 3 version pinned in the project is not installed, the following dialog appears, offering to open the project with the latest version of the same release. In this case, a Twin CAT 3 project should be opened in which Twin CAT 3 version 4020.15 is pinned. The Twin CAT 3 versions with the build numbers 4020.14, 4020.26 and 4021.45 are installed on this system. Since version 4020.26 is the latest revision of build 4020, this is offered for opening the project even if a newer version (build 4021) is available. If the project is to be loaded with a newer Twin CAT 3 version because the version pinned in the project does not exactly correspond to the version installed on the system, please proceed as described in the section “Opening a project with a newer Twin CAT 3 version”. Case 2: the Twin CAT 3 version is not pinned in the project. In this case you must manually determine the Twin CAT version with which the project was last saved. Carry out the following steps to do this: 1. Double-click on the project folder or the Twin CAT 3 project file. ð Once the project has been opened, you can determine the Twin CAT 3 version with which the project was last saved by double-clicking on the System node in the Twin CAT 3 project tree. It is located behind the Project field in the Version section on the General tab. 2. If the opened version doesn't already match the Twin CAT 3 version with which the project was last saved, please close the Visual Studio Shell. 3. Open the Visual Studio Shell. 4. Select the Twin CAT 3 version to be loaded in the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar. 5. Select the project again with the aid of the option File -> Open -> Working folder/Project. ð The project is now open in the selected Twin CAT 3 version. Open the Twin CAT 3 version of the connected target system If the Twin CAT 3 version used on the target system is to be loaded, proceed as follows: 1. Open the Visual Studio Shell. 2. Select the option "Choose from Target System…" in the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar. ð The loaded Twin CAT 3 version is displayed in the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar with the suffix "Loaded". Opening a project with a newer Twin CAT 3 version If a project is to be opened with a newer Twin CAT 3 version (even if the Twin CAT 3 version is pinned in the project), proceed as follows: 1. Open the Visual Studio Shell. 2. Select the Twin CAT 3 version with which the project is to be opened in the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar. 3. Select the project with the aid of the option File -> Open -> Working folder/Project. 12 Version: 1.2.1 TE1000

Applications 4. Confirm the dialog asking whether the project is to be opened with the loaded version. ð The project is now open in the selected Twin CAT 3 version. Creating a project with an older Twin CAT version If a new Twin CAT 3 project is to be created with an older Twin CAT 3 version, proceed as follows: 1. Open the Visual Studio Shell. 2. Select the Twin CAT 3 version with which the project is to be opened in the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar. ð Once the Twin CAT 3 components have been completely loaded, this will be indicated in the Twin CAT XAE Remote Manager Toolbar by the text "Loaded" after the loaded Twin CAT 3 version. 3. Create the new project. Older library versions When selecting an older Twin CAT version, the older library versions will not automatically be used for new projects. If these are to be used they must be explicitly selected. TE1000 Version: 1.2.1 13

Application notes 5 Application notes The following points should be observed when using the Twin CAT 3 Remote Manager: • The Remote Manager installation must be older than the Twin CAT 3 development environment that it is installed on. As a result, the installer for the respective versions of the Twin CAT 3 Remote Manager is only made available on our website with the subsequent Twin CAT 3.1 version. • The Remote Manager version for each Twin CAT 3 version is also always included in the full setup and will remain on the computer even if a newer Twin CAT version is installed on top of it. • Once selected, a Twin CAT 3 version can no longer be unloaded in an opened instance of the Visual Studio Shell. If you wish to work with a different Twin CAT version, you will need to open a new instance of the Visual Studio Shell or of Twin CAT. • Not all installed Remote Manager versions are available in all Visual Studio Shells. The following table lists the supported Visual Studio Shells. Twin CAT 3 version Supported VS Shells Twin CAT 3.1.4016 VS2010 – VS2013 Twin CAT 3.1.4018 VS2010 – VS2013, VS2017 (for versions >= TC 3.1.4018.58) Twin CAT 3.1 4020 VS2010 – VS2015, VS2017 (for versions >= TC 3.1.4020.56) Twin CAT 3.1 4022.0 – 4022.4 VS2010 – VS2015 Twin CAT 3.1 >=4022.14 VS2010 – VS2017 Twin CAT 3.1 4024.0 VS2013 – VS2017 Twin CAT 3.1 >=4024.10 VS2013 – VS2019 14 Version: 1.2.1 TE1000
