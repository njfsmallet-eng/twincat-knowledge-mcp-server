Overview 2 Overview The Twin CAT 3 PLC Profiler is an analysis tool that is used for performance evaluation and optimization of PLC programs within the Twin CAT 3 software environment. It enables the collection of detailed execution data from PLC code blocks, making it easier to identify runtime inefficiencies and potential areas for improvement. The Profiler is designed to provide comprehensive data on the execution time of PLC programs. This data is essential for finding and eliminating performance bottlenecks in automation systems. The profiler differs from other diagnostic and analysis tools by its specific focus on the Twin CAT 3 PLC development environment and its ability to provide detailed execution information of the PLC code. This in- depth analysis capability is especially useful for developers who need detailed insights into the execution times and behaviors of their PLC programs. 8 Version: 1.0.0 TE1210

Important notes 4 Important notes Observe the following instructions when using the Profiler. NOTICE Changed time behavior of the IEC program when using the Profiler functionalities The Profiler measurements change the runtime behavior of the IEC program. The effects depend on the PLC program architecture and the Profiler configuration. NOTICE Watchdog exceptions when using the Profiler functionalities The Profiler measurements change (slow down) the runtime behavior of the IEC program. Watchdog exceptions may occur. • You should therefore only use the profiler functions in a secure test environment. Change Profiler settings via download Switching the profiling function on and off and changing the Profiler configuration will force a download. It is not possible to load these changes to the controller using Online Change. Libraries Twin CAT can only record calls to the application code of the current PLC project, the referenced libraries remain unnoticed! • If you want to record calls from libraries, you can encapsulate these calls in actions in the application code. • You can then record these actions. 10 Version: 1.0.0 TE1210

Configuration 5 Configuration Creating the configuration in the Twin CAT 3 PLC Profiler is a crucial step that enables the measurement and analysis of PLC programs. The configuration window allows you to select the specific program blocks to be monitored during the profiling process. The user interface offers intuitive features such as the creation of blacklists and whitelists to precisely define which parts of the program should be included or excluded from the measurement. You can use a drop-down menu to decide whether the POUs (Program Organization Units) to be measured should be configured on the basis of a blacklist or whitelist. The blacklist acts as an exclusion list, while the whitelist specifies exactly which elements are to be examined. The Add button allows you to add new program blocks to the configuration list. This list forms the core of the configuration and serves as the basis for profiling. The Instrumented Elements information display provides information on how many elements are already configured for profiling. This provides a clear overview and makes it easier to manage sophisticated projects. You can also use this configuration interface to determine which functions and methods are highlighted to ensure that the critical parts of the code are monitored and analyzed.

Basics 6 Basics Profiling is a process in software development and optimization and refers to the process of analyzing a software application to understand various aspects of its execution, such as the duration of function calls. The aim of profiling is to identify performance bottlenecks, inefficient code and unexpected behavior in order to improve the performance and efficiency of the application. The Twin CAT 3 PLC Profiler uses the "instrumentation" measurement principle, where specific marks (entry and exit methods) are inserted into the code in order to measure the execution times of individual function blocks or code segments. One of the biggest advantages lies in the detailed insights that the process offers. It enables the accurate measurement of execution times and the frequency of calls to each individual function block within the program. This precision in measurement is essential to understand how the code behaves and where there may be potential for improvement. Optimization also plays a key role. The insights gained not only allow you to identify performance bottlenecks, but also to address and eliminate them in a targeted manner. This leads to improved efficiency and performance of the application, which is particularly important in time-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. However, there are also important aspects to consider that can influence the results and their interpretation. On the one hand, the measurement marks that are placed in the code lead to an additional load on the system. This can affect the actual execution times and should be taken into account when analyzing the measurement results. On the other hand, this can lead to unwanted weighting: areas of the code that are provided with many measurement marks may appear over-represented in the analysis because the measurement methods themselves take time. This effect must be taken into account when analyzing the data to ensure an accurate interpretation of the code's performance. In the further application of the Twin CAT 3 PLC Profiler, various challenges resulting from the complexity and dynamics of advanced PLC systems have to be taken into account. One such challenge is the inter- cycle variability of measured values caused by dynamic CPU clocking and other factors. Although measures such as using isolated cores or disabling power management mechanisms can reduce variability, it remains an issue that affects the interpretation of profiling results. In addition, the implementation of the trace procedure, which measures the entire call tree in each cycle, can lead to an increase in real-time load, which can affect the performance of the system. Another issue is the increase in network utilization due to the transmission of measured values via ADS, especially with high information density. This increase in network traffic must be considered when planning profiling activities. By taking a careful approach, developers can gain valuable insights into the performance of their applications and make targeted optimizations to improve the efficiency and reliability of their systems. 12 Version: 1.0.0 TE1210
