Overview 2 Overview The Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor is an engineering tool for creating and editing OPC UA nodeset files, which are used for companion specifications and other elements. With the help of the editor, you can map existing companion specifications or your own information models on your Beckhoff controller and link them with data points from the PLC. When developing a machine application, there are often requirements for the structure of the OPC UA namespace of a machine to be mapped. In this case, it is necessary to establish conformity to a companion specification or a customer-specific information model so that the machine can be integrated as smoothly as possible into an existing and standardized environment. The Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor is the graphical solution to meet this challenge. It allows: • Loading nodeset files from companion specifications or custom information models. • Creation of simple user-defined nodeset files. • Convenient linking of objects from the controller with those from a loaded or created nodeset. • Using the nodeset for new and existing machines using the Twin CAT OPC UA Server (TF6100). Use cases The Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor supports the user in the implementation of requirements regarding companion specifications by providing a graphical user interface that enables the import of nodesets. However, even without requirements for a specific companion specification, the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor may be a useful tool and assist in the following use cases. Creation of custom server address space Even before companion specifications became widespread, there were initial requests to make information from the PLC available on the Twin CAT OPC UA Server according to a defined structure. By default, the server uses the IEC61131-3 information model to provide variables from the PLC via OPC UA. However, sometimes this data representation on the server is not desired and there were requests for a "simple modeling option for folders and simple data types". This use case can be addressed with the help of this product. Linking variables and methods from existing nodesets Nodesets that have been created with a third-party tool, such as the UA Modeler (https://www.unified- automation.com), can be imported into the Twin CAT OPC UA Server. However, since third-party tools do not have any variable information from a Twin CAT control program, the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor 8 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

## Page 9

Overview can be used instead. The existing nodesets can be imported into the graphical user interface of the Nodeset Editor and linked there with PLC variables and job methods using the Twin CAT Target Browser. The resulting nodeset file can then be deployed to the Twin CAT OPC UA Server. Creating instance nodesets from a companion specification The import of companion specifications and the creation of instances from the data and object types contained therein is required if a machine is to be equipped with a standard interface defined by the companion specifications. The Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor enables the instantiation of such data and object types and the subsequent linking of the instances with variables and job methods from the Twin CAT PLC. Workflow The workflow when using the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor to create a nodeset and the subsequent export to the Twin CAT OPC UA Server can be illustrated as follows. In step (1) the nodeset file (the "companion specification") is imported into the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor. This means that the data types defined in the file are available in the editor environment and can be used for project planning. In step (2) and (3) the project engineering takes place, i.e. objects ("instances") are created from the data types and linked with variables from the PLC. In step (4) the generated project is exported to the Twin CAT OPC UA Server so that it can provide the generated information model in its address space.

Technical introduction 4 Technical introduction 4.1 Quick Start The following chapter will guide you through some quick start tutorials on how to use the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor. Please make sure that you have followed the installation instructions and that your system meets the system requirements. The following quick start tutorials are available: Tutorial Description Simple nodeset with base types [} 14] Demonstrates how to create a nodeset with simple data type instances. Simple companion specification [} 20] Demonstrates how to create a nodeset with object instances from a companion specification. 4.1.1 Simple nodeset with base types This documentation article is intended to get you started using this product quickly. After successful installation [} 10] and licensing [} 11], perform the following steps to create an initial nodeset. OPC UA Core Nodeset By default, the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor automatically loads the OPC UA Core Nodeset, which defines the namespace http://opcfoundation.org/UA/. TF6100 TC3 OPC UA Server This product works together with the Twin CAT OPC UA Server to run a created Nodeset and display it on the server's address space. Please ensure that the TF6100 TC3 OPC UA Server product is installed locally and/or on your target system. The following Quick Start tutorial will guide you through the following steps: • Preparing a PLC project • Creating a new project • Creating instances from the OPC UA Core Nodeset • Linking the created instances with PLC variables • Deployment of the project on the local Twin CAT OPC UA server Preparing a PLC project Create a new Twin CAT project and add a PLC project. Create the following data structure in the PLC project and instantiate it three times in the MAIN program. TYPE ST_My Structure : STRUCT My Boolean : BOOL; My Int16 : INT; My Float : REAL; END_STRUCT END_TYPE PROGRAM MAIN VAR My Struct1 : ST_My Structure; My Struct2 : ST_My Structure; My Struct3 : ST_My Structure; END_VAR Creating a new project To create a new Nodeset project, please open the menu File and click on New > Project. 14 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

## Page 15

Technical introduction In the following selection dialog, you can configure the name for the project and, if the checkbox is activated (by default), a nodeset to be created. The name and the (namespace) Uri for a new information model can be defined in this nodeset. Creating Instances In this tutorial, we want to create a number of instances with simple data types (Integer, Boolean, Float) and group them in three different folders. Go to the Instance Explorer and add three folders by selecting the Objects node and choosing Add Folder from the context menu. The three folders will then be shown as follows: TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 15

## Page 16

Technical introduction Rename the folders by double-clicking on each folder and adjusting the Name attribute in the Attribute Explorer accordingly. Save this change via the Save button on the toolbar. Perform this procedure for all three folders so that the Instance Explorer looks like this: In the next step we want to add some variables to the folders. Creating new variable or object instances is usually done by a drag and drop operation from a data type on the Type Explorer. Select the first folder in the Instance Explorer and then navigate to the desired data type in the Type Explorer. Drag and drop the data type onto the selected folder in the Instance Explorer. As a result, a corresponding instance of this data type is created there. In our example, we use the Boolean data type. We now repeat this step with two more data types, e.g. Int16 and Float, and perform this process for the other two folders as well. If necessary, you can adjust the name of the added variable by double-clicking on it and then renaming it in the Attribute Explorer. 16 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

## Page 17

Technical introduction Linking with PLC variables We want to link the now created instances with variables from our prepared PLC project. For this purpose, the Twin CAT Target Browser can be used, which you can open in the menu Tools. Navigate to the prepared PLC project in the Target Browser and link the individual member variables of the ST_My Structure data structure with the corresponding instances by dragging and dropping them onto the corresponding node in the Instance Explorer. The link will then be visible in the tree structure and can be checked in the Node Editor. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 17

Technical introduction Deployment of the project on the local Twin CAT OPC UA server To deploy the project to the local Twin CAT OPC UA Server, click the Deploy configuration to local Twin CAT OPC UA Server button in the Instance Explorer toolbar. This exports the project nodeset, including the necessary dependencies, to the locally installed Twin CAT OPC UA Server and also creates a corresponding configuration file for the server. The directory from the options or the project file is used as the target (see Application and project settings [} 42]). Please make TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 19

## Page 20

Technical introduction sure that you restart the Twin CAT OPC UA Server after you have deployed the nodeset so that the configuration is loaded. The address space of the server then contains the created nodes, which were linked with the corresponding PLC variables. 4.1.2 Simple companion specification This documentation article is intended to get you started using this product quickly. After successful installation [} 10] and licensing [} 11], perform the following steps to create an initial nodeset based on a companion specification. OPC UA Core Nodeset By default, the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor automatically loads the OPC UA Core Nodeset, which defines the namespace http://opcfoundation.org/UA/. TF6100 TC3 OPC UA Server This product works together with the Twin CAT OPC UA Server to run a created Nodeset and display it on the server's address space. Please ensure that the TF6100 TC3 OPC UA Server product is installed locally and/or on your target system. Companion specification sample nodeset As an example of a companion specification, a nodeset is used that defines an Object Type "My Object Type" with a few member variables. This nodeset can be downloaded from our TE6100_Samples repository on Git Hub [} 49]. The following Quick Start tutorial will guide you through the following steps: • Preparing a PLC project • Creating a new project • Importing the companion specification nodeset • Creating object instances • Linking the created instances with PLC variables • Deploying the project to Twin CAT OPC UA Server 20 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

## Page 21

Technical introduction Preparing a PLC project Create a new Twin CAT project and add a PLC project. Create the following data structure in the PLC project and instantiate it three times in the MAIN program. TYPE ST_My Structure : STRUCT My Boolean : BOOL; My Int16 : INT; My Float : REAL; END_STRUCT END_TYPE PROGRAM MAIN VAR My Struct1 : ST_My Structure; My Struct2 : ST_My Structure; My Struct3 : ST_My Structure; END_VAR Creating a new project To create a new Nodeset project, please open the menu File and click on New > Project. In the following selection dialog, you can configure the name for the project and, if the checkbox is activated (by default), a nodeset to be created. The name and the (namespace) Uri for a new information model can be defined in this nodeset. Importing the Companion Specification Nodeset Import the file "te6100_quickstart_companion_specification.xml" from the Git Hub repository into the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor by clicking the button Load Nodeset in the Type Explorer. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 21

## Page 22

Technical introduction The import loads the type model from the nodeset into the Type Explorer and displays it there. The type model contains an Object Type "My Object Type", which we now want to instantiate. You can use the textbox to search for the type name or you can scroll to that type, which can be found under the Object Types \ Base Object Type node. Creating object instances Use the context menu to create a new folder in the Instance Explorer. You can rename the folder by double- clicking on it and then renaming the "Name" attribute in the Attribute Explorer. Then save this change via the Save button in the Attribute Explorer toolbar. Then drag and drop the type "My Object Type" from the Type Explorer into the created folder in the Instance Explorer. 22 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

## Page 23

Technical introduction This creates a new object instance of the type "My Object Type" and places it in the folder created. All mandatory member variables of the type are transferred accordingly to the Instance Explorer and displayed there as nodes below the object instance. You can now link these nodes with SPS variables. You can rename the instance via the Attribute Editor. Linking the created instances with PLC variables We now want to link the member variables of the now created object instance with variables from our prepared PLC project. For this purpose, the Twin CAT Target Browser can be used, which you can open in the menu View. Navigate to the prepared PLC project in the Target Browser and link the individual member variables of the data structure with the corresponding member variables of the object instance by dragging and dropping them onto the corresponding node in the Instance Explorer. The data types here are as follows: Member variable Data type Member1 Boolean (BOOL) Member2 Int16 (INT) Member3 Float (REAL) You can also get this information from the Attribute Explorer if you double-click on the variable. As soon as you have linked all variables you can activate the project on the Twin CAT OPC UA Server in the next step. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 23

## Page 24

Technical introduction Deployment of the project on the local Twin CAT OPC UA server To deploy the project to the local Twin CAT OPC UA Server, click the Deploy configuration to local Twin CAT OPC UA Server button in the Instance Explorer toolbar. This exports the project nodeset, including the necessary dependencies, to the locally installed Twin CAT OPC UA Server and also creates a corresponding configuration file for the server. The directory from the options or the project file is used as the target (see Application and project settings [} 42]). Please make sure that you restart the Twin CAT OPC UA Server after you have deployed the nodeset so that the configuration is loaded. The address space of the server then contains the created nodes, which were linked with the corresponding PLC variables. 24 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

Technical introduction 4.2 Supported features With the help of OPC UA, complex information models can be created. This page provides an overview about the currently available features of the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor. Additional features will be provided as updates over time. Feature Description Creation of nested folders Allows the creation of (nested) folders, e.g. to structure instances. Instantiation of data types Allows the instantiation of data types from the OPC UA Core Nodeset. The following data types, as well as their derived types, are supported: Boolean, SByte, Byte, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64, Float, Double, String, Date Time, Byte String, Node Id, Localized Text, EUInformation, Range, Time Zone Data Type, Utc Time, Option Set Instantiation of data types as arrays Enables the instantiation of arrays of data types from the OPC UA Base Nodeset. The above types are supported. To do this, the Value Rank and Array Dimensions attributes must be set accordingly on the instance created: Example: For a one-dimensional array with a length of 10: Instantiation of object types Allows instantiation of object types from an imported nodeset, (with and without methods) e.g. a companion specification. Certain restrictions may apply, see below. Instantiation of structured data types Enables the instantiation of structured types (all data types derived from “Structure”) from an imported nodeset, e.g. a companion specification. Certain restrictions may apply, see below. This may require further configuration steps, which are explained in more detail in our documentation about Mapping [} 34]. Mapping of variables and methods Enables the linking of the created instances with elements from the PLC. The Twin CAT Target Browser (Tools => Target Browser) serves as the basis for this feature. Online and offline mapping to various Mappings can be added to various active target systems via the target systems ADS tab in the Target Browser. Mappings can be added offline using a TMC file via the TMC tab. Handling of the Modeling Rules (Optional, When an object type is instantiated, sub-elements with the Mandatory, etc.) “Optional” and “Mandatory” Modelling Rule are automatically added. Unwanted optional elements can be removed manually. Export to local Twin CAT OPC UA Server Enables the export of the created nodeset project to the locally installed Twin CAT OPC UA Server. This is explained in more detail under Exporting a project [} 46]. Export to a folder Enables the export of the created nodeset project to a user- defined folder for manual copying to the server directory of a Twin CAT OPC UA Server. This is explained in more detail under Exporting a project [} 46]. Restrictions Below you will find an overview of which features are currently not available, yet. Additional features are added over time via software updates of this product. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 25

## Page 26

Technical introduction Feature Description Dynamic array lengths The instantiation of arrays with dynamic length is possible, but such arrays cannot currently be used in the Twin CAT PLC or the Twin CAT OPC UA Server. This applies for Array Dimensions = 0 or Value Rank = [ -3 | -2 | 0]. Multi-dimensional arrays It is possible to instantiate arrays with more than one dimension, but such arrays cannot currently be used in Twin CAT PLC or the Twin CAT OPC UA server. This applies to Value Rank ≠ 1. Handling of the Modelling Rules Nodes with the "Optional Placeholder" and (Optional Placeholder, "Mandatory Placeholder" Modelling Rule must be created Mandatory Placeholder, etc.) manually. This is currently only possible to a limited extent. Placeholder instances in the type cannot be instantiated directly. When instantiating manually under the instance of the correct data type, the reference type for the parent node cannot be modified (see below). Create/Modify types Creating new data or object types or changing existing types is currently not supported. Static node values It is currently possible to set a static value for a node using an experimental editor (this is only recommended for experts). However, static values in the Nodeset are not loaded by the Twin CAT OPC UA Server. References Currently the references of a node cannot be modified. When adding folders or Instances of nodes, these are referenced using Organizes references. Mapping of structures with PLC keyword/ If an OPC UA structure type has a field with the name "Type", identifier conflicts for example, this structure cannot currently be created in the PLC, as "Type" may not be used as the identifier of a PLC variable. This applies to all keywords. The following general rules for identifier assignment apply. 4.3 License information There are different licenses that can be purchased for the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor. The following table provides an overview of the different licenses that are available for this product. License Description 7-day trial license A 7-day trial license can be used with this product. It allows all the functionalities of the TE6100 license (see below) but doesn’t allow to save or deploy the project. TE6100 This is the base license that is required to use the product. It allows access to all product functionalities but the ones defined by an add-on license. TE6101 This license is an optional add-on license that allows to use the automatic code generation feature. 4.4 User interface 4.4.1 Overview The user interface is divided into different areas, which will be described in more detail below.

Technical introduction The numbers on each node represent the Namespace Index of a particular node and may be useful for easier identification of nodes. The following table shows all actions that you can perform within the Type Explorer. Action Description Import Nodeset Allows to add more nodesets. Drag&Drop By using the Drag&Drop operation on a particular node and drag that node to the Instance Explorer, you can create an instance from that type. Search You can search for nodes by entering the name or Node Id of the node into the corresponding textbox. Additional search strings are: ns=x (searches for nodes in a particular Namespace Index) 4.4.3 Instance Explorer The Instance Explorer displays all instances in this project. Further actions are available via the toolbar. The following table lists all the actions you can perform in the Instance Explorer, arranged in the order of the buttons. 28 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

(CTRL + C) Paste an instance Creates a new instance of the previously copied type (CTRL + V) definition under the selected node and avoids name conflicts. Search You can search for nodes by entering the name or (CTRL - F in Instance Explorer) Node Id of the node into the corresponding text box. Additional search strings are: ns=x (searches for nodes in a particular Namespace Index) Has Extension (searches for nodes with a mapping to a PLC variable) Has No Extension (searches for nodes without a mapping to a PLC variable) Quotation marks around the search parameter allow you to exclude overlapping hits. (Example: "ns=1" does not search for ns=10.) Context menu (right mouse button) Removes the currently selected node and the closely connected subnodes. Please note that other Delete node subnodes (without the Parent Node Id attribute) are (DEL) not removed and are considered to be "orphaned" if they have no other parent node. Context menu (right mouse button) Removes the mapping of the selected node to a PLC variable, if available. Remove mapping (SHIFT + DEL) Context menu (right mouse button) Creates a new instance of the type Folder Type. Create folder (CTRL + SHIFT + N) 4.4.4 Node Editor The Attribute Explorer displays the attributes of the currently selected node. Both the attributes of nodes from the Type Explorer and the Instance Explorer can be displayed. By double-clicking on a node, its attributes are loaded and displayed accordingly. Further actions are available via the toolbar. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 29

## Page 30

Technical introduction The following table shows all actions that you can perform within the Attribute Editor. Action Description Edit attributes Edit attributes of the currently opened node. Save Applies any changes to the attributes. XML View Allows to display the currently selected node as XML. 4.4.5 Models The Information Models window shows all currently loaded namespaces – both from all loaded type or instance nodesets. This window allows you to choose which namespace you want to edit when creating instances out of a data or object type. The namespace that is currently marked as editable is used when creating new instances. Nodesets can also be loaded via the context menu. A namespace can be selected as editable and filtered according to a namespace. If the editable nodeset is filtered, this is done in the Instance Explorer. If you filter for a non-editable nodeset, this is done in the Type Explorer. This feature uses the search in the Explorers, which you can customize manually. 4.4.6 Menu The menu includes different mechanisms related to the currently opened project. The following table provides more information about each menu entry. 30 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

Technical introduction 4.5 Mapping The Twin CAT Target Browser is available for linking OPC UA nodes to PLC symbols, which will add the address information of a PLC symbol to an OPC UA node. The nodeset can then be made available on the Twin CAT OPC UA Server. Objects Objects cannot be linked to PLC symbols since they do not have a value that could be linked. Variables and properties The mapping of variables and properties can be done by using the Twin CAT Target Browser. Please note that the data type of the PLC variable must "match" the data type of the OPC UA Node. Depending on the setting (Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Disable mapping validation & Show hint if mapping may not be valid) you will either be prevented from mapping or notified if a mapping does not fit. Further information regarding the assignment can be found at Data type assignment Twin CAT <=> OPC UA [} 39]. Structures Structured types can also be linked to a PLC structure via the Twin CAT Target Browser. However, there are a few special features to be considered here. On the one hand, the data structure in the PLC must "fit" the OPC UA data structure and, on the other hand, the data structure in the PLC still requires the OPC UA type information as a PLC attribute. The following button can be used to conveniently call these attributes for structure types and instances of a structure type: 34 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

## Page 35

Technical introduction The following OPC UA structure is given as an example. <UAData Type Node Id="ns=1;i=3015" Browse Name="1:Model Data Type"> <Display Name>Model Data Type</Display Name> <References> <Reference Reference Type="Has Encoding">ns=1;i=5048</Reference> <Reference Reference Type="Has Encoding">ns=1;i=5050</Reference> <Reference Reference Type="Has Encoding">ns=1;i=5049</Reference> <Reference Reference Type="Has Subtype" Is Forward="false">i=22</Reference> </References> <Definition Name="1:Model Data Type"> <Field Data Type="Byte" Name="Switching Object Identification"/> <Field Data Type="Byte" Name="Switching Object Number"/> <Field Data Type="Date" Name="Current Date"/> <Field Data Type="Int32" Value Rank="1" Array Dimensions="1" Name="Switching Times"/> </Definition> </UAData Type> The structure in the PLC must then have the following structure: PROGRAM MAIN VAR My Model : ST_Model Data Type; END_VAR {attribute 'OPC. UA. DA' := '1'} {attribute 'OPC. UA. DA. Structured Type' := '1'} {attribute 'pack_mode' := '1'} {attribute 'OPC. UA. Additional Structured Type. Namespace Name' := 'name Space Name Nodeset'} {attribute 'OPC. UA. Additional Structured Type. Id' := 'i=3015'} TYPE ST_Model Data Type : STRUCT Switching Object Identification : BYTE; Switching Object Number : BYTE; Current Date : DT; Switching Times : ARRAY[0..2] OF DINT; END_STRUCT END_TYPE The additional attributes OPC. UA. Additional Structured Type. Namespace Name and OPC. UA. Additional Structured Type.id are necessary so that the Twin CAT OPC UA Server can assign the type information. They represent the namespace and the Node ID of the data type of the Structured Type. The Twin CAT Target Browser can then be used to map My Model Instance with the PLC variable MAIN. My Model Data Type. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 35

## Page 36

Technical introduction Methods Methods can be linked to a PLC function block via the Twin CAT Target Browser. However, there are a few special features to be considered here. On the one hand, the function block in the PLC must "fit" the OPC UA method and on the other hand, the function block in the PLC requires the structure of a so-called job method. This is explained in Job methods in the Twin CAT OPC UA Server documentation. As the OPC UA method is extensively defined, only the key data of the OPC UA method is given here: Four Input Parameters: Boolean, Int16, String, Enum (INT16) Four Output Parameters: Boolean, Int16, String, Enum (INT16) The PLC method is as follows: //Funktionsbaustein Deklaration: {attribute 'OPC. UA. DA. Job Method' := 'Method2_With Simple Arguments'} FUNCTION_BLOCK PUBLIC FB_Method2_With Simple Arguments 36 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

Mapping a method looks like this: The parameters can be checked via the Twin CAT Symbol Mapping using the following buttons and adjusted if necessary. OPC UA and PLC must be compatible! 38 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

Technical introduction 4.5.1 Data type assignment Twin CAT <=> OPC UA The following three tables provide an overview of the assignment of Twin CAT data types (IEC61131-3) and their corresponding OPC UA data types (Built-In types) as defined in the OPC UA Core Namespace http:// opcfoundation.org/UA/. Twin CAT 3 library - Tc3_Opc Ua When installing the editor via Tc Pkg, the Tc3_Opc Ua library is installed. This contains some type definitions that can be used in combination with the editor. The following table assigns each Twin CAT data type to its OPC UA Base Data Type (Built-In) according to the PLC-Open specification. Please note that there is no OPC UA data type for the Twin CAT data type BIT. In addition, the Twin CAT special data types are treated separately. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 39

Installation folder The installation folder of this application is located under the Twin CAT installation directory. %Tc Install Dir%\Functions\TE6100-OPC-UA-Nodeset-Editor Configuration files This application uses different configuration files, which are located in a subfolder of the Program Data directory: TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 41

## Page 42

Technical introduction %Program Data%\Beckhoff\TE6100-OPC-UA-Nodeset-Editor Libraries There is a central directory in which you can store nodeset files that you repeatedly need to use in your projects as libraries. Each time you want to import a nodeset file into your current project, the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor opens this “Library” directory, which is located in a subfolder of the user's home directory: %User Profile%\Documents\Beckhoff\TE6100-OPC-UA-Nodeset-Editor\ Projects Per default, new projects are created in a subfolder of the user’s home directory: %User Profile%\Documents\Beckhoff\TE6100-OPC-UA-Nodeset-Editor\Projects Log files The Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor creates log files that may contain useful information in case anything goes wrong. These log files are located in a subfolder of the Program Data directory: %Program Data%\Beckhoff\TE6100-OPC-UA-Nodeset-Editor\Log Deploy and export directory The Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor can export the current project either to the locally installed Twin CAT OPC UA Server or to a user-defined directory. The directories can be set in the options and are as follows by default: %Tc Install Dir%\Functions\TF6100-OPC-UA\Win64\Server\ %User Profile%\Documents\Beckhoff\TE6100-OPC-UA-Nodeset-Editor\Projects\<Current Project>\Export 4.7 Application and project settings The application itself and each project includes XML-based configuration files, which contain different settings that influence the behavior of the application. Such settings are described in the following chapters. Application settings The configuration file directory (see Application directories [} 41]) includes the file TE6100.config, which contains configuration parameters for the Twin CAT OPC UA Nodeset Editor application. There is a graphical dialog for this file in the user interface under Tools => Options. Unless otherwise stated, changes take effect immediately. 42 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

When creating a new project, this path corresponds to the default value (see above - General | OPC UA Server Dir), but you can override it for specific projects. Nodesets Contains a list of all nodesets that belong to this project including their path, Namespace Name, version and Publication Date. If an invalid configuration is recognized, you will be presented with a dialog informing you about the invalid parameter. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 45

## Page 46

Technical introduction Declining the dialog will reset the value to its default setting. Alternatively, you can confirm the dialog and correct the value manually: The software then starts. 4.8 Exporting a project The user interface offers two options for exporting and using the current project with a Twin CAT OPC UA Server. The first option for the local server is primarily designed for the "Same system" scenario described in Usage scenarios [} 52]. The second option for non-local servers is primarily intended for the "Different systems" scenarios. Deployment of the project on the local Twin CAT OPC UA server To deploy the project to the local Twin CAT OPC UA Server, click the Deploy configuration to local Twin CAT OPC UA Server button in the Instance Explorer toolbar. 46 Version: 1.2.0 TE6100

## Page 47

Technical introduction This exports the project nodeset, including the necessary dependencies, to the locally installed Twin CAT OPC UA Server and also creates a corresponding configuration file for the server. The directory from the options or the project file is used as the target (see Application and project settings [} 42]). Please make sure that you restart the Twin CAT OPC UA Server after you have deployed the nodeset so that the configuration is loaded. The address space of the server then contains the created nodes, which were linked with the corresponding PLC variables. Deployment of the project on a non-local Twin CAT OPC UA Server To deploy the project to a Twin CAT OPC UA Server that is not installed locally, click on the Export configuration to a folder of your choosing button in the Instance Explorer toolbar. A selection dialog opens, which opens in the export directory (see Application and project settings [} 42]) by default. TE6100 Version: 1.2.0 47

## Page 48

Technical introduction Once a folder has been selected, the project nodeset, including any necessary dependencies, is exported to this folder and a corresponding configuration file is created for the server. The entire contents of the folder can then be copied manually to a current Twin CAT 3 OPC UA Server (see Usage scenarios [} 52]). If direct file access is possible, this can simply be done via Explorer, for example: If several Twin CAT OPC UA Servers are in use, the last step of the deployment can be repeated as often as required for non-local servers. Plans are in place for further deployment options in a future version of the editor that will simplify the transfer process to the Twin CAT OPC UA Server even more.

Appendix 7 Appendix 7.1 Terminology Nodeset A nodeset is a file that formally describes an OPC UA information model. Nodeset files are usually XML- based and must be structured according to an XML schema definition. Nodesets are used for processing information models with the computer. A nodeset defines nodes, their attributes, and references. A reference can point to nodes in the same document as well as to nodes outside the file. OPC UA itself defines some central information models with corresponding nodesets, for example: Name Namespace Core („Base“) http://opcfoundation.org/UA DI http://opcfoundation.org/UA/DI GDS http://opcfoundation.org/UA/GDS Particularly noteworthy is the "Core" model, whose nodeset is also colloquially referred to as the "Base" nodeset. The core model usually serves as a basis for other information models and describes the basic data types that are available in OPC UA. Companion specifications Although the existing OPC UA information models are already applicable in many industries, it is possible to create own information models to meet specific requirements. For this purpose, companies and organizations join forces to define industry-specific models, so-called "companion specifications". Such companion specifications are available, for example, for the packaging industry (Pack ML) or for plastics processing (EUROMAP). Further information on this topic can be found on the OPC Foundation website. Node A node is a fundamental part of the address space of a server and represents an object, variable or method. Even data and object types are represented on the server’s address space as a node. 7.2 Troubleshooting Behavior Description Cannot export nodeset to Twin CAT OPC Please make sure that you have write access to the Twin CAT UA Server. The log shows an error “Failed OPC UA Server installation directory. If the Twin CAT OPC UA to write …”.
