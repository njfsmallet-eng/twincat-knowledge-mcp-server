Overview 2 Overview The Tc2_Coupler library can be used for the following products: BKxxx couplers, KLxxx terminals, KSxxxx terminals and KMxxx modules. The Tc2_Coupler library contains function blocks that provide convenient access to registers in the terminals via the terminal's control/status byte (register communication) and for communication with the Beckhoff couplers via the 2-byte PLC interface. The function blocks can, for instance, be used for parameterization of the terminals by way of the fieldbus. Only the intelligent terminals have a register structure. The intelligent terminals include, for example, all the analog input and output terminals. The terminal's status/control byte is only visible in the process image if the terminal has been mapped as a complex terminal. Each terminal channel has its own register structure with a maximum of 64 registers. Under a compact mapping the control/status bytes are not visible in the process image. For register access via the 2-byte PLC interface it is also necessary for the status and control word variables of the PLC interface to be mapped into the process image. In some fieldbusses (Lightbus, Profibus) this can be configured for the particular coupler in the Twin CAT System Manager, but in others (e.g. Interbus S) special configuration software is required for the job (e.g. KS2000). The status and control variables are linked to the function block's corresponding input and output variables. If any changes made to the registers are to be stored permanently, the power supply to the coupler must be interrupted. NOTICE No cyclic access! When called, the function blocks of the library carry out write/read access to the registers in the terminals or in the couplers. If they are called cyclically, the EEPROM memory may be destroyed. The function blocks were basically developed to facilitate configuration of the terminals/couplers or fault diagnosis from within the PLC program.

Function blocks 3 Function blocks 3.1 Read Write Terminal Reg The function block Read Write Terminal Reg enables convenient access to the terminal's registers via the control/status byte of the terminal channel (register communication). In the standard operation mode, the data inputs and outputs of the intelligent terminals (e.g. an analog output terminal) are used to exchange the analog output data. A handshake via the control/status byte permits register access. The data input and output variables are used here to transfer the register values. A positive edge at the READ or WRITE input causes the register with number REGNO to be read or written to. Write protection of the register is disabled by the function block for a write access and enabled once more afterwards. With a write access to a register, the new register value is written first and then read. The value read is available at the output CURRREGVALUE. If changes made to the register values are to be stored permanently, the power supply to the coupler must be interrupted. The variables STATE, DATAIN, CTRL and DATAOUT must be linked in the Twin CAT System Manager to the corresponding I/O variables in the terminal channel. Inputs VAR_INPUT STATE : BYTE; DATAIN : WORD; REGNO : BYTE; READ : BOOL; WRITE : BOOL; TMOUT : TIME; NEWREGVALUE : WORD; END_VAR Name Type Description STATE BYTE Status byte of the terminal channel. DATAIN WORD Data input word of the terminal channel. REGNO BYTE Number of the register to read or write. READ BOOL A positive edge at this input activates the function block, and the current register value is read. If successful, the register value is available in the output variable CURREGVALUE. WRITE BOOL A positive edge at this input activates the function block, and the value in the input variable NEWREGVALUE is written into the register REGNO. The current value of the register is then read and, if successful, is available in the output variable CURREGVALUE. TMOUT TIME Specifies the time-out period that must not be exceeded when the function is executed. NEWREGVALUE WORD Data word to be written to the register numbered REGNO during a write access. Outputs VAR_OUTPUT CTRL : BYTE; DATAOUT : WORD; BUSY : BOOL; ERR : BOOL; TE1000 Version: 1.1.1 9

Function blocks ERRID : UDINT; CURREGVALUE : WORD; END_VAR Name Type Description CTRL BYTE Control byte of the terminal channel. DATAOUT WORD Data output word of the terminal channel. BUSY BOOL When the function block is activated, this output is set and remains set until the function is completed. ERR BOOL If an error occurs during the execution of the function, this output is set after the BUSY output is reset. ERRID UDINT If the ERR output is set, this parameter supplies the error number. Error number Error description 0 No error 0x100 Timeout error. The permitted execution time has been exceeded 0x200 Parameter error (e.g. an invalid register number) 0x300 The value read differs from the value written (write access to this register may not be permitted or may have failed) Name Type Description CURREGVALUE WORD This variable provides the current register value after a successful read or write access.

The variables State, Control, Data In and Data Out are linked to the terminal's corresponding I/O variables in the Twin CAT System Manager. The terminal identifier is KL4022.. Example 2 10 Version: 1.1.1 TE1000
## Page 11

Function blocks In Example 2 the user-scaling is activated in the feature register (register 32) of a KL4022 analog output terminal. The new value in the feature register is then read by the function block, and can be checked through the output variable CURREGVALUE. Requirements Development environment Target system type PLC libraries to include (cate- gory group) Twin CAT v3.1.0 PC or CX (x86, x64, ARM) Tc2_Coupler (IO) 3.2 Coupler Reset The function block Coupler Reset can be used to execute a reset of the coupler via the 2-byte PLC interface. During a coupler reset, for example, the current terminal configuration is read in again by the coupler via the K-bus (terminal bus) and communication on the K-bus is reinitialized. Existing K-bus error messages for the coupler are reset. The STATE and CONTROL variables are used to perform a handshake with the coupler during the execution of the function block. These variables must therefore be linked to the Control/Status variables of the 2-byte PLC interface in the Twin CAT System Manager. Inputs VAR_INPUT STATE : PLCINTFSTRUCT; START : BOOL; TMOUT : TIME; END_VAR Name Type Description STATE PLCINTFSTRUCT [} 18] Status word of the 2-byte PLC interface. START BOOL The function block is enabled by a positive edge at this input. TMOUT TIME Specifies the time-out period that must not be exceeded when the function is executed. Outputs VAR_OUTPUT CONTROL : PLCINTFSTRUCT; BUSY : BOOL; ERR : BOOL; ERRID : UDINT; END_VAR TE1000 Version: 1.1.1 11

Function blocks Name Type Description CONTROL PLCINTFSTRUCT [} 18] Control word of the 2-byte PLC interface. BUSY BOOL When the function block is activated, this output is set and remains set until the function is completed. ERR BOOL If an error occurs during the execution of the function, this output is set after the BUSY output is reset. ERRID UDINT If the ERR output is set, this parameter supplies the error number. Error number Error description 0 No error 0x100 Error during initialization of communication via the 2-byte PLC interface 0x200 Error during communication 0x300 Timeout error. The permitted execution time has been exceeded 0x400 Incorrect parameter value for register number 0x500 Incorrect parameter value for table number Example of a call in FBD: VAR Intf State AT%I* : PLCINTFSTRUCT; Intf Control AT%Q* : PLCINTFSTRUCT; Coupler Reset1 : Coupler Reset; Start_Coupler Reset : BOOL; Coupler Reset_Busy : BOOL; Coupler Reset_Err : BOOL; Coupler Reset_Err Id : UDINT; END_VAR The variables Intf State and Intf Control are linked with corresponding I/O variables in the Twin CAT System Manager. Requirements Development environment Target system type PLC libraries to include (cate- gory group) Twin CAT v3.1.0 PC or CX (x86, x64, ARM) Tc2_Coupler (IO) 3.3 FB_Read Coupler Diag The function block FB_Read Coupler Diag allows reading of the first and second flashing sequences of the error LED on the coupler when a terminal bus or coupler error occurs. The data is transferred to the PLC via the 2-byte PLC interface. This only works if communication is maintained via the fieldbus. It must be possible to transfer data from the coupler to the PLC via the fieldbus without errors. To detect a coupler error that has occurred, the status byte of the coupler can be queried cyclically in the PLC and the function block is activated if an error occurs. 12 Version: 1.1.1 TE1000
