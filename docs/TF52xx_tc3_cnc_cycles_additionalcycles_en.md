Overview 1 Overview Cycles are additional options and subject to the purchase of a license. Additional cycles can be used provided one or the three cycle main licenses (Machining, Measurement and Calibration and calibrating, Machine Calibration) is installed. Task In addition to existing cycles, the additional cycles offer the following scope of functions: 1. The positioning cycles [} 9] are intended to calculate and pre-position the tool. Normally, the cycles are called in conjunction with machining, measuring or calibration cycles. 2. The calculation cycles [} 22] are used to execute complex calculations that require the user to have a lot of technical knowledge and carry out extensive programming work. 3. In general, the machine response can be optimised by means of channel parameters using the High Speed Settings cycle [} 34]. This allows you to influence the surface quality, speed and accuracy for a specific machine. 8 Version: 1.1 TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Additional Cycles

Positioning cycles 2 Positioning cycles 2.1 Introduction Cycles are additional options and subject to the purchase of a license. Overview The positioning cycles are intended to calculate and pre-position the tool. Normally, the cycles are called in conjunction with machining, measuring or calibration cycles. Possible applications The following applications are conceivable: • Calculate a plane by specifying reference points • Rotate the machining coordinate system to an inclined plane • Rotate the tool to an inclined plane • Using predefined call patterns to call a cycle Programming The cycles are called with the L CYCLE[…] function and the required parameters are taken directly from the NC program. A more detailed description of the call is provided in the subsections for each of the cycles. TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.1 9 Additional Cycles

Positioning cycles 2.2 Sys Pos Rotation To Plane - Rotate to plane This cycle rotates the tool and/or the machining coordinate system [MCS] to a plane defined by the input parameters. The required plane is defined by rotation angle or reference points. Optionally, the resulting machining coordinate system can be checked in advance by an output. This cycle can be used after a teach-in cycle to rotate to the measured MCS. Z Y X Y Z X Fig. 1: Sys Pos Rotation To Plane 2.2.1 Process If the tool needs to be rotated to the defined plane, a complete kinematic transformation must be active before the cycle. At the start of the cycle, the tool is retracted along the Z axis by the section set in @P2. The following processes can be set by the rotation mode @P1_ • @P1=1: The machining coordinate system and tool are rotated to the defined plane • @P1=2: Only the tool is rotated to the defined plane • @P1=3: Only the machining coordinate system is rotated to the defined plane • @P1=4: No movement occurs / change in MCS This mode can be used to calculate and output the MCS resulting from the input parameters. Once the machining coordinate system is rotated (@P1=1 or @P1=3), after the cycle a rotated MCS with zero offset is active on the origin defined by @P3@P5. This can be deselected by #CS OFF. To check the correct definition of the required plane, the resulting MCS can be output to a text file by @P20=1. The calculated axes of the MCS represented in the MCS are then written to the text file Sys Pos Rotation To Plane Result.txt. 10 Version: 1.1 TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Additional Cycles
## Page 11

Positioning cycles 2.2.2 Definition of the plane by reference points The rotation plane can be defined by 3 points (@P6@P14) in the current tool CS. The target plane is defined when these parameters are transferred. The resulting machining coordinate system is then calculated so that all 3 points lie on the XY plane. The following also applies: • The X axis of the resulting MCS is parallel to the vector of the 1st reference point in relation to the 2nd reference point • The Z axis lie perpendicular to the XY plane and is positioned so that its value in Z is positive • The Y axis is defined so that it forms a right-hand system to the X and Z axes Fig. 2: Definition of the plane 2.2.3 Definition of the plane by angles The rotation plane can also be defined by angles of rotation (@P15@P17). The target plane is defined when these parameters are transferred. The plane is then implemented by rotation about the axes of the current MCS. Rotation is also possible by projection angle (rotation axes also rotate, @P18=1) and spatial angle (rotation axes remain fixed, @P18=2). The rotation sequence can be defined by @P19. For more information on rotating an MCS about coordinate system axes, see the documentation on #CS command. If the rotation cycle is combined with a teach-in cycle to measure inclined planes, the plane can be defined by angles. Here, it is sufficient to transfer the output variables of the teach-in cycle directly: @P15=V. CYC. SYS_A, @P16=V. CYC. SYS_B, @P17=V. CYC. SYS_C. The rotation mode and the rotation sequence can remain at the default values. TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.1 11 Additional Cycles

Positioning cycles 2.3 Sys Pos Pattern - Generate call pattern This function is available as of CNC Build V3.01.3079.37. The pattern cycle describes a higher-level functionality that allows cycles to be executed multiple times at predefined positions. As opposed to the existing MODAL_MOVE / MODAL_BLOCK function, rotations can also be defined. During cycle execution, they are active in the form of a machining coordinate system. The list below shows the possible applications that are conceivable in conjunction with the pattern cycle: • Execute ISG cycles at several predefined positions • Execute user-defined cycles at several predefined positions • Define additional rotations which are active at cycle execution Fig. 5: General call patterns 2.3.1 Define a call pattern in NC program code Time of definition No call patterns are predefined at controller start-up. A definition in the configuration lists is not possible. Call patterns are defined directly in the NC program in a sequence of position and rotation definitions embedded in plain text commands. The call patterns used must then be defined before a machining cycle is called. The call pattern definition is valid until it is overwritten, deleted or until program end. Start of a call pattern definition # PATTERN BEGIN [ID<expr>] ID <expr> Identification number of the call pattern. A call pattern definition is activated by #PATTERN BEGIN [ID<expr>]. The freely selectable identification number is then transferred. If a call pattern already exists with the required identification number, it is overwritten by the new call pattern. End of a call pattern definition TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.1 15 Additional Cycles
## Page 16

Positioning cycles # PATTERN END Each call pattern definition must be closed by the command #PATTERN END. Standard commands can only be used again when the call pattern definition is closed. Programming description - Description of a call pattern #PATTERN BEGIN [ID=1] #AT [100, 0, 0] #AT [100,100, 0,0,0,90] #AT [0 ,100,100] #PATTERN END Each call pattern definition starts with the command #PATTERN BEGIN and must be closed by the command #PATTERN END. Between these commands, you can describe the required positions and rotations. Positions and rotations are defined by the command #AT. The first 3 input values describe the positions at which the cycle is to be executed. The last 3 input values describe the rotations that are to be activated when the cycle is executed. The angle definition must be selected according to the rotation of a machining coordinate system]. Currently, only one rotation is permitted about the Z axis. If no rotations are defined, it is sufficient to only define the first 3 values for the #AT command. Delete call pattern The command to delete a call pattern contains the following syntax elements: # PATTERN DELETE [ID<expr>] ID <expr> Identification number of the call pattern It is also possible to delete currently defined call patterns and clear the memory location for new definitions. # PATTERN DELETE ALL Information on deleted call patterns is irrevocably lost. The assigned memory location is then cleared for new call pattern definitions. Only existing call pattern definitions can be deleted. Programming example - Delete call pattern # PATTERN DELETE [ID3] ( Delete specific call pattern with ID3) # PATTERN DELETE ALL ( Delete all call patterns) 2.3.2 Process After a call pattern is defined [} 15], the related cycles can be called to execute it at the predefined positions. A call pattern retraction plane PATTERN_RETRACT must also be defined. This is where the tool retracts to every time before it is repositioned. When the call pattern ID is transferred at cycle call, the cycle "Sys Pos Pattern Wrapper.ecy” stored in the cycle packet is called internally. The position in X and Y is then approached on the call pattern retraction plane for each position and rotation definition (#AT) contained in this cycle. The rotations and the transferred Z position are then activated as a machining coordinate system before the required cycle is executed. 2.3.3 Parameterisation Parameterisation mainly consists of the definition of the call pattern [} 15]. 16 Version: 1.1 TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Additional Cycles

Erosion machining 3 Erosion machining 3.1 Overview Supplementing CNC erosion functions with several functionalities. Possible applications • Safe electrode retraction out of the workpiece in the event of interruptions. 3.2 Sys Edm Electrode Retract - Electrode retraction An EDM-Plus license is sufficient for this cycle. If an interruption in machining occurs during die sinking is caused by a power failure of a CNC error, the electrode remains in the workpiece and it is then impossible to continue machining. The Sys Edm Electrode Retract cycle allows the safe retraction of the electrode in the event of interruptions in die sinking. This is essential in order to protect the electrode and workpiece and continue machining. 3.2.1 Process A safe retraction geometry is defined as the geometry that would create an escape channel using the retract strategy set at the point of interruption. The end position of the retraction is always defined as the starting point of the “path erosion” geometry. The two figures below show an example of machining up to an interruption followed by retraction after the interruption. The plane strategy at the point of interruption in the example is set as the retract strategy. Fig. 6: Error when erosion process is active TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.1 19 Additional Cycles
## Page 20

Erosion machining Fig. 7: Retraction geometry due to electrode retraction cycle starting at the point of interruption If a CNC error occurs, the required data is saved automatically by the CNC. The save_retract_data control unit is provided in the event of a power failure or other cases where the user must save data for a future retraction. If the save process is triggered, it must be ensured that data is saved only after the CNC comes to a standstill. Restrictions • Retraction geometry does not consider whether the electrode was located in the equidistant section at the point of interruption. In this case, therefore, the retraction geometry does not have exactly the same transition as a retraction with the system escape channel before the point of interruption. • The user must save the necessary parameters for the CNC cycle at the point of interruption himself and transfer the data to the CNC when the CNC cycle is called. • The channel parameter P-CHAN-00865 must be set in order to save the data. • This cycle requires the EDM-Plus license. 3.2.2 Parameterisation Required input parameters Input Description parameters @P2 Retraction velocity [mm/s, inch/s] @P3 Program name to enable the kinematic transformation and programming of control information, e.g. #FGROUP, MODULO before the “path erosion” section. @P4 Program name containing the geometry for the “path erosion” section. @P5 Program name to enable PCS transformations after the “path erosion” section.

Calculation cycles 4 Calculation cycles 4.1 Introduction Cycles are additional options and subject to the purchase of a license. Task Calculation cycles are used to execute complex calculations that require the user to have a lot of technical knowledge and carry out extensive programming work. The following calculation cycles are currently available: • Calculation of the diameter and centre point of a 2-dimensional circle consisting of min. 3 sampling points • Calculation of the diameter and centre point of a sphere consisting of min. 4 sampling points • Calculation of a plane consisting of min. 3 sampling points • Calculation of a circle in 3D space consisting of min. 3 sampling points • Calculation of a straight line in 3D space consisting of min. 2 sampling points The calculation cycles use the “method of least squares” to calculate the most probable result from a specific number of sampling points. Programming and parameterisation The programming and parameterisation of cycles is described in each of the overviews in the main chapter. Handling output variables If the V. CYC output variable is created in the main program (or in the subroutine calling the cycle), the value is written within the cycle and is available in the main program after the calculation. The calculation cycles described below include programming examples that can be used to understand how to interpret the output variables. 22 Version: 1.1 TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Additional Cycles

High Speed Settings 5 High Speed Settings 5.1 Introduction In general, the machine response can be optimised by means of channel parameters using the High Speed Settings cycle. This allows you to influence the surface quality, speed and accuracy for a specific machine. Cycles are additional options and subject to the purchase of a license. Task The High Speed Setting cycles optimise the machining response of a specific machine by specifying tolerances for • roughing • prefinishing • finishing . The user can use the cycle to select the required machining state to influence machine response. Licensing note Please note that cycles are additional options and subject to the purchase of a license. 5.2 Sys Hsc Settings cycle - High Speed Cutting settings Velocity HSC Accuracy Surface finish Fig. 13: Operation mode of HSC settings 5.2.1 Process The Sys Hsc Settings cycle can optimise machine response. NC programs can be specified in the channel- specific lists. They are called depending on the specified mode. The parameters for this are: • hscs.deselect.prog 34 Version: 1.1 TF52xx | Twin CAT 3 CNC Additional Cycles
