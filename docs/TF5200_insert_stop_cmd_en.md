Overview 1 Overview Task The function "Insert motion stops during processing" permits the insertion of CNC stop marks in the future processing of an NC program while it is being processed. Effectiveness / possible applications • The function can be used for processes where a stop point is not yet known before program start. • Another application is for alternating stop points while a program is being processed. This function is available as of CNC Build V3.1.3105.01 Parameterisation P-STUP-00033 [} 26] must be parameterised in order to use the function. Mandatory note on references to other documents For the sake of clarity, links to other documents and parameters are abbreviated, e.g. [PROG] for the Programming Manual or P-AXIS-00001 for an axis parameter. For technical reasons, these links only function in the Online Help (HTML5, CHM) but not in pdf files since pdfs do not support cross-linking. 8 Version: 1.14 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Insert stop command

Description 2 Description The function " Insert motion stops during processing" permits the insertion of CNC stop marks for the future processing of the program while a program is running. This can be used, for example, for process-controlled machining operations executed in parallel where the positions for these operations are not yet known before program start. Stop marks are usually inserted via the PLC with the Control unit – Insert stop marks (insert command) [} 23]. Alternatively, stop marks can also be inserted via the NC program, see Programming [} 25].. The STOP position is specified depending on the mode used. The following modes are available: • Mode = POSITION – STOP position dependent on an axis position • Mode = DISTANCE – STOP dependent on distance from program start (“dist_prog_start“ control unit [} 26]) Stop marks are represented by optional M functions. The program is continued after the M function is acknowledged in the PLC. TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 9 Insert stop command

Description 2.1 Properties General properties: • The user can insert a new stop mark while the program in running during motion or at standstill. • The position of the STOP in the program can be preset depending on the mode used. • A STOP is represented by a programmed/selectable stop (M00/M01) or a user-defined M function acknowledged in any way. • A M00/M01 transfers the channel to the stop state and is exited by "Continue movement". With a user- defined, arbitrary M function, the channel does not revert to stop state but waits for the default acknowledgement from the PLC. • If the new STOP is specified during the motion, the channel is stopped briefly, the STOP is inserted and the channel continues to the newly set STOP. If the new STOP is commanded during standstill, the new STOP is set immediately. • A STOP can also be commanded before program start. A STOP after program end is set to the end of the program. • Cross-program STOPs are not possible. • STOPs can be set with a preset absolute or relative position. If STOPs have a relative preset, they can be commanded once or can be automatically commanded iteratively • An already specified STOP can be cleared by the value 0 if a relative dimension is specified, provided the STOP is not reached. When a new STOP is specified, the current STOP is cleared and the new STOP is set. • When a STOP inserted by the PLC is reached, it is additionally signalled by a special stop condition (stop_condition_r) . They can be read as follows: ◦ by the HLI [} 26] ◦ by the associated CNC object [} 27] • The function can also be used in the backward direction. 10 Version: 1.14 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Insert stop command
## Page 11

Description 2.1.1 DISTANCE mode • In DISTANCE mode, the location of the STOP is specified by the “dist_prog_start” control unit [} 26]. • "dist_prog_start" is the absolute path travelled from program start and is monotonically increasing. This means that each program position can be uniquely identified. • The "dist_prog_start" value can be reset with the NC command #DISTANCE PROG START CLEAR. • Return values from the CNC to the PLC (display data) are the axis positions of the first three axes and the "dist_prog_start" at the next/current STOP. • A STOP that is set absolute or a one-off relative STOP is cleared during forward/reverse rotation. Relative iterative STOPs are retained. The table below shows the possible combinations of the parameter “dist_or_pos” and the parameter “rel_abs_mode” and the resulting behaviour of the CNC for DISTANCE mode (`axis_nr `= 0): Specified dimension Distance (dist_or_pos) CNC behaviour (rel_abs_mode) relative iterative (0) =0 a possibly set STOP that is not yet reached is cleared <0 immediate one-off STOP at current distance >0 (possibly interrupt) new STOP relative to the current distance, automatic new relative STOPs after continuation of the previous STOP. absolute (1) =< current distance immediate STOP at current distance > current distance STOP at commanded distance relative one-off (2) =< 0 immediate STOP at current distance > 0 (possibly interrupt) and insert a STOP relative to current distance TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 11 Insert stop command

Description 2.1.2 POSITION mode • In POSITION mode, any axis position can be specified. When this axis position is reached for the first time, the system stops. This means that if the same axis position is passed again, it is not stopped again. • Modulo axes are handled as follows. ◦ Absolute position: The specified axis position is shifted to the modulo range. A maximum of one revolution can be moved as a result. ◦ Relative position: The commanded axis position describes the path to be traversed to the next stop point. Therefore, more than one revolution can be moved to the next STOP. • Return values from the CNC to the PLC (display data) are the axis positions of the commanded axes and the "dist_prog_start" at the next/current STOP.. • A STOP that is set is cleared with forward/backward rotation by a PLC command (backward_motion control unit). This means that a STOP in backward direction must only be commanded after the revolution. The table below shows the possible combinations of the parameter “dist_or_pos” and the parameter “rel_abs_mode” and the resulting behaviour of the CNC for POSITION mode (`axis_nr `> 0): Specified dimension Distance (dist_or_pos) CNC behaviour (rel_abs_mode) relative iterative (0) = 0 a possibly set STOP that is not yet reached is cleared <> 0 STOP relative to the current axis position (or interrupt point), automatic new relative STOPs when STOP is reached. absolute (1) = current axis position STOP at current axis position <> current axis position STOP the next time the axis position is reached relative one-off (2) = 0 STOP at current axis position (or interrupt point) <> 0 One-off STOP relative to current axis position (or interrupt point) TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 13 Insert stop command

Description 2.1.3 Combination of functions “Insert motion stops during processing” and real-time loops When combining the "Insert motion stops during machining" function with "Distance" mode and the real-time loops function when using the "MODULO" option, the following special features must be considered: • An absolute commanded stop is only possible within the current loop or after exiting the loop. • A relative one-time stop in a future loop that is not reached by a premature exit is rejected.

Description 2.2 Applications 2.2.1 POSITION mode application The "Insert stop marks" function in POSITION mode can be used for machining with continuously fed material with a local offset technology process. For example, in tube or wire machining, the workpiece length is defined by cutting at the start and end of the NC program. If a technology process is also applied, e.g. the tube is insulated by laser, this insulation process takes place at a local offset position. In the laser insulation process, the CNC must be at a standstill. This can be achieved by inserting a STOP with the "Insert stop marks" function. Since laser processing is locally displaced from the actual programming point, laser processing in the following program may require a STOP in the current program. This relationship is shown in the figure below. The position axis shown is intended to represent the position of the tube feed axis across programs. The position traversed then corresponds to the length of the tube produced at the end. Fig. 11: POSITION mode application If the program sequence is not defined in advance, the STOP position in the program is only known during the program run. The STOP can therefore not be implemented by NC programming. The "Insert stop marks" function can be used to insert a STOP online during program processing as soon as the next programme is known.

Description 2.2.2 DISTANCE mode application In multichannel machining, where the resulting geometry is created by superimposing individual channels, it may be necessary to stop one channel while the other channel(s) continue machining. An example of this is a machining operation with two channels working in planes perpendicular to each other. The figure below shows the movement of the first channel superimposed by an orbiting movement about the Z axis of the second channel. Fig. 12: DISTANCE mode application Process-controlled, the same geometry is traversed several times with different process settings. Each process setting requires STOPs in the first channel (discs in the figure), while the second channel continues orbiting until a sufficient quality is reached. The "Insert stop marks" function offers the option to set the discs for the current process setting at the start of each process setting marking the start of the program. Due to the 2D motion of the channel, equidistant discs can be inserted in the program using the distance traversed. 2.3 Combination of functions “Insert motion stops during processing” and real-time loops When combining the "Insert motion stops during machining" function with "Distance" mode and the real-time loops function when using the "MODULO" option, the following special features must be considered: • An absolute commanded stop is only possible within the current loop or after exiting the loop. • A relative one-time stop in a future loop that is not reached by a premature exit is rejected. 20 Version: 1.14 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Insert stop command

Programming 4 Programming The NC command #INSERT CMD can be used to specify stop marks via the NC program. The "AXNR" parameter is used to set the mode. • AXNR = 0 – DISTANCE mode (default) • AXNR !=0 – POSITION mode Syntax: #INSERT CMD [ON | OFF] [AXNR=.. MNR=.. ADDR=.. DIST=.. [ABS | REL | REL_ONCE] ] ON Insert stop marks is enabled OFF Insert stop marks is disabled. This results in a stop at the program position. AXNR=.. Logical axis number Stop is inserted at the commanded axis position of the axis with this logical axis number. Note: Mode is defined by specifying the logical axis number. AXNR = 0 – DISTANCE mode is used AXNR !=0 – POSITION mode is used Default value = 0 MNR=.. Number of the inserted M function • Value = 0 for M00 programmed stop (default) • Value = 1 for M01 optional stop (enabled/disabled with m01_stop_enable CU) • Value > 1 for M<m_function_nr> with MVS_SVS synchronisation ADDR=.. Optional additional value of the M function; it is specified as a negative or positive integer. DIST=.. Relative/absolute distance or axis position in [0.1µm] at which the stop is to be inserted. Dependent on the mode used ABS One-off insertion at the absolute distance REL for relative distance with automatic insertion of a new stop when the current stop is reached. REL_ONCE One-off insertion at the relative distance. The distance specification ABS/REL or REL_ONCE are mutually exclusive. When you use simultaneous programming within an #INSERT CMD instruction, the error is output with ID 22130. The default assignment of the NC command is: #INSERT CMD [MNR=0 DIST=0 REL AX=0] If M function < 2 is specified, the command for continuing machining must be given by the "Continue motion" control unit after the STOP is reached. If M function is specified >= 2, the default acknowledgement of the M function is sufficient. The bit in the stop conditions [} 26] is displayed on the HLI when an inserted stop is reached. The combination of the parameters DIST=0 and REL=1 clears the previously set STOP irrespective of the parameters MNR and AXNR, The current distance can be reset with #DISTANCE PROG START CLEAR.

Parameter 5 Parameter Start-up parameters P-STUP-00033 Memory size for backward motion Description This parameter defines the memory size in bytes used for backward motion on the path. During start-up, the NC checks whether the required minimum size is available. If this is not the case, a warning is output and the memory size is set to the required minimum value. If the size is set to 0, the “forward/ backward motion on the path” function is not available. The maximum size is only limited by the resources available on the PC.
