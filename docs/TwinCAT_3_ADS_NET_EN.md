NET API Documentation [} 14] 4.1 Access Data via Index Group/Index Offset Reading/Writing values by Index/Group index offset are the most basic way to access data via ADS. This address combination directly link into the process image of virtual ADS Devices. As long the process image is static this is unproblematic and a system near access, but if the content is more dynamic and the address changes over time the Index Group/Index Offset can get invalid. Examples about moving addresses could be: • Changed Parametrization of IO (and Re-activation) • The PLC Online change • New Plc Downloads In that case other access methods could be advantageous. Another important point is that the data access is not type safe. The values are read or written to or from byte buffers and the proper marshalling/unmarshalling is the task of the application code. Example Access Process Image Data by Index Group/Index Offset using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { UInt32 value To Read = 0; UInt32 value To Write = 42; client. Connect(Ams Net Id. Local, 851); // Write an UINT32 Value Ads Stream write Stream = new Ads Stream(sizeof(uint)); Ads Binary Writer writer = new Ads Binary Writer(write Stream); writer. Write(value To Write); TE1000 Version: 1.1 19
## Page 20

Concepts ads Client. Write(0x4020, 0x0, write Stream, 0, 4); // Read an UINT32 Value Ads Stream read Stream = new Ads Stream(sizeof(uint)); ads Client. Read(0x4020, 0x0, read Stream, 0, 4); read Stream. Position = 0; Ads Binary Reader reader = new Ads Binary Reader(read Stream); value To Read = reader. Read UInt32(); } 4.2 Use of ADS Notifications If values from a PLC or NC are to be displayed continuously on a user interface, then it is very inefficient to use asynchronous read access, since this function must be called cyclically (polled triggered by a timer). Instead of using a pulling (read) model, ADS Notifications are implementing a push model. That means ADS Notifications are triggered by the sender and form a single or series of ADS messages/events. Together with these ADS Notifications, values can be transmitted. A distinction is drawn between whether the Twin CAT server is to transmit the values cyclically, or only when the values change. In principle (raw mode) a notification is begun with the registration of the notification Add Device Notification [} 726]. After this, events are automatically fired by Twin CAT. Delete Device Notification [} 767] is used to halt the notification again. Since the number of notifications is limited, you should ensure the notifications no longer required by your program are unregistered/deleted. There exist several 'modes' for different type of ADS Notification triggers. For a complete list please consult Ads Trans Mode [} 438]. All the following examples demonstrate how to receive ADS Notifications. The . NET ADS API supports different information layers which different levels of ADS Notification support. All are using a PLC variable in the PLC and each time the value of the PLC variable changes, an ADS Notification message is sent and the registered callback method is invoked with event arguments that contain all the necessary information (value, time stamp, ...). Hint: Don't use time intensive executions or ADS commands inside of your callback (not more than approx. 500). Remind to sync your callback in your main thread (typically the UI thread) if necessary, because the ADS Notifications appear on a background thread. Using ADS Notifications with Symbolic information C# private void Symbol Value Changed() { using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { // Connect to target client. Connect("1.2.3.4.5.6", 851); Symbol symbol = null; try { ISymbol Loader loader = Symbol Loader Factory. Create(client, Symbol Loader Settings. Default); // DINT Type (UINT32) symbol = (Symbol)loader. Symbols["MAIN.n Counter"]; // Set the Notification Settings of the Symbol if Notification Settings. Default is not approp riate // Check for change every 500 ms symbol. Notification Settings = new Notification Settings(Ads Trans Mode. On Change, 500, 0); symbol. Value Changed += Symbol_Value Changed; // Registers the notification Thread. Sleep(5000); // Sleep the main thread to get some (asynchronous Notifications) } finally { // Unregister the Event and the underlying Handle symbol. Value Changed -= Symbol_Value Changed; // Unregisters the notification } } 20 Version: 1.1 TE1000

Symbol; // Object Value can be cast to int automatically, because it is an Primitive Value (DINT -- > Int32). // The Symbol information is used internally to cast the value to its appropriate .

IDisposable subscription = cycle Count. When Value Changed(). Take(20). Subscribe(value Observer); Console. Read Key(); // Wait for Key press subscription. Dispose(); // Dispose the Subscription } 4.3 Access Data via Symbolic path The Read/Write Access by symbol path solves the issue of directly accessing the process image. With specifying the access path to the symbol, the symbol address can be found by a binary search (internally) and reading / writing symbols is independent of the location within the process image. This access method can only be used, when the ADS device is supporting symbolic information like the Twin CAT PLC. Because its indirect access, the performance is slightly worse than the direct access via Index Group/ Index Offset. However there are internal optimizations to cache handles to the already used symbols to accelerate repeated access. 22 Version: 1.1 TE1000
## Page 23

Concepts Example Access symbolic data by instance/symbol path using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { UInt32 value To Read = 0; UInt32 value To Write = 42; client. Connect(Ams Net Id. Local, 851); ads Client. Write Symbol("MAIN.n Counter", value To Write, false); value To Read = (uint)ads Client. Read Symbol("MAIN.n Counter", typeof(UInt32),false); } 4.4 Access Data via Symbol handles The Read/Write Access by handle solves the issue of directly accessing the process image like the symbol path access. Because the address is accessed indirectly by the symbol path creating a variable handle, the read/write works also when the data object has changed its position within the process image. However the cost for this are two extra ADS communication roundtrips by the 'Create Variable Handle' and 'Delete Variable Handle' calls compared to the Index Group/Index Offset access methods. It is the responsibility of the application code to optimize these accesses. Example Access symbolic values by handle using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { int var Handle = 0; client. Connect(Ams Net Id. Local, 851); try { UInt16 value To Read = 0; UInt16 value To Write = 42; // Create the Variable Handle var Handle = client. Create Variable Handle("MAIN.test Var"); //Test Var is defined as PLC INT // Write an UINT16 Value Ads Stream write Stream = new Ads Stream(sizeof(UInt16)); Ads Binary Writer writer = new Ads Binary Writer(write Stream); writer. Write(value To Write); // Marshal the Value ads Client. Write(var Handle, write Stream,0,sizeof(uint)); // Read an UINT16 Value Ads Stream read Stream = new Ads Stream(sizeof(UInt16)); ads Client. Read(var Handle, read Stream, 0, sizeof(UInt16)); read Stream. Position = 0; Ads Binary Reader reader = new Ads Binary Reader(read Stream); value To Read = reader. Read UInt16(); // Unmarshal the Value } finally { // Unregister Var Handle after Use client. Delete Variable Handle(var Handle); } } 4.5 Value marshalling with ANYTYPE concept This topic describes reading and writing variables/symbols of 'any' type with the help of the Read Any and Write Any (Read Symbol, Write Symbol) methods. The value will be marshalled / cast directly from/to its appropriate . NET type, what eases the value access. 'Any' types in this context are all types that are 'blittable' to the process image - what means that the memory layout is equal (e.g primitive types) or is marshallable by the default marshalling of . NET (see 'Plc Struct' in the example below). TE1000 Version: 1.1 23
## Page 24

Concepts The appropriate . NET type must be known during compile time and is passed to the methods as parameter. In case of a Read Any call, the read data will be returned as a object. The type of the object is marshalled to the type specified as parameter type. Because the data size and the memory alignment is taken from this type specification, it is so important that this specification fits to the memory representation in the ADS device (e.g. the PLC). Because some data types(arrays and strings) need additional information, an overload of the method Read Any exists, that takes an additional parameter args. A Full list of supported types can be found in the documentation of the overloaded method. Reading and writing of structures To be able to read or write PLC structures the memory layout of the structure or class in . NET must be the same as in the PLC. The layout of a structure or class can be specified with the attribute Struct Layout Attribute. The Layout Kind must be set to Layout Kind. Sequential and the pack must be set to 1 If arrays, strings or boolean values are define the class, one has to specify how these fields should be marshalled. This is accomplished with help of the Marshal As attribute. Because arrays and strings do not have a fixed length in . NET, the property Size Const is necessary for arrays and strings. Marshalling values with 'ANY_TYPES' using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { client. Connect("1.2.3.4.5.6", 851); // Bool value bool bool Value = (bool)client. Read Symbol("MAIN.bool1", typeof(bool), false); ads Client. Write Symbol("MAIN.bool1", bool Value,false); // or int handle1 = ads Client. Create Variable Handle("MAIN.bool1"); // BOOL bool Value = (bool)client. Read Any(handle1, typeof(bool)); ads Client. Write Any(handle1, bool Value); ads Client. Delete Variable Handle(handle1); // Real Value int handle2 = ads Client. Create Variable Handle("MAIN.bool1"); // BOOL float real Value = (float)client. Read Any(handle2, typeof(float)); // REAL client. Write Any(handle2, real Value); ads Client. Delete Variable Handle(handle2); // String int handle3 = ads Client. Create Variable Handle("MAIN.string1"); // STRING[80] string string Value = (string)client. Read Any(handle3, typeof(string), new int[] { 80 }); // Needs additional para for strlen ads Client. Write Any(handle3, string Value, new int[] { 80 }); // ushort[] int handle4 = ads Client. Create Variable Handle("MAIN.uint1Arr"); // ARRAY [0..9] OF UINT ushort[] ushort Arr = (ushort[])client. Read Any(handle4, typeof(ushort[]), new int[] { 10 }); ads Client. Write Any(handle4, ushort Arr, new int[] { 10 }); ads Client. Delete Variable Handle(handle4); // Complex Struct Type // Take care the the corresponding . NET Type is blittable / marshallable to the PLC type int handle5 = ads Client. Create Variable Handle("MAIN.struct"); Plc Struct struct Value = (Plc Struct)ads Client. Read Any(handle5, typeof(Plc Struct)); ads Client. Write Any(handle5, typeof(Plc Struct)); ads Client. Delete Variable Handle(handle5); // ARRAY [0..9] OF STRING[80] // args[0] --> Number of Characters // args[1] --> Number of Array Elements // Needs additional para for strlen and number of Elements in Array int handle6 = ads Client. Create Variable Handle("MAIN.string Arr"); // ARRAY [0..9] OF STRING[80] string[] string Arr = (string[])client. Read Any(handle6, typeof(string[]), new int[] { 80, 10 }); ads Client. Write Any(handle6, string Value, new int[] { 80 }); ads Client. Delete Variable Handle(handle6); } 24 Version: 1.1 TE1000

Ansi)] public struct Plc Struct { // Type must be 'blittable' to the corresponding PLC Struct Type // See MSDN for Marshal As and Default Marshalling. [Marshal As(Unmanaged Type.

U4)] public uint tod Val; // TOD [Marshal As(Unmanaged Type. U4)] public uint dateval; // DATE [Marshal As(Unmanaged Type. U4)] public uint dt Val; // DT } ADS Notifications with Type marshalling (Ads Notification Ex) The method Add Device Notification Ex is used to register notifications for a PLC variable. If the value of a variable changes the event Ads Notification Ex is fired. The difference to the event Ads Notification, is that the value of the variable is stored in an object instead of in an Ads Stream. Therefore one has to pass the type of the object to the method Add Device Notification Ex Notifications with 'ANY_TYPES' using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { client. Ads Notification Ex += Client_Ads Notification Ex; client. Connect("1.2.3.4.5.6", 851); // Add UDINT int notification Handle = client. Add Device Notification Ex("MAIN.udint", Ads Trans Mode. On Change, 200 , 200, null, typeof(uint)); Thread. Sleep(5000); // ... client. Delete Device Notification(notification Handle); // Unregister Event } Notifications with 'ANY_TYPES' private void Client_Ads Notification Ex(object sender, Ads Notification Ex Event Args e) { uint value = (uint)e. Value; // Marshalled value as . NET Type } 4.6 Access Data via Symbol Loader Some ADS Devices (e.g. the Twin CAT PLC) provide symbolic information for download. That means all visible Symbols and Data Types can be retrieved from the target system. While this need an extra effort to upload and hold the data, this feature helps to remove the dependency of the code/configuration running on the target device. E.g. because the symbolic information can now be browsed and determined during runtime, the application can be written without knowing what's running on the target system. Even more having the Symbol information cached, the access of the process image data will be easier because the datasize and access (instance path) is stored in the symbol. TE1000 Version: 1.1 25
## Page 26

Concepts Dependent how it is parametrized, the symbol loader can work with 'ANY_TYPES' (marshallable Primitive types, Value marshalling with ANYTYPE concept [} 23]) or full dynamic symbols (Automatic dynamic marshalling of values [} 26]). Example Accessing symbolic data by preloaded Symbolic information using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { UInt32 value To Read = 0; UInt32 value To Write = 42; client. Connect(Ams Net Id. Local, 851); // Load all Symbols + Data Types ISymbol Loader loader = Symbol Loader Factory. Create(client, Symbol Loader Settings. Default); Symbol symbol = (Symbol)loader. Symbols["MAIN.n Counter"]; // Works for ALL Primitive 'ANY TYPES' Symbols symbol. Write Value(value To Write); value To Read = (UInt32)symbol. Read Value(); } 4.7 Automatic dynamic marshalling of values The 'Dynamic Symbol Loader' of the . NET ADS Communication API makes use of the . NET dynamic language runtime (DLR). The dynamic language runtime is a runtime environment that adds a set of services for dynamic languages to the common language runtime (CLR). The DLR makes it easier to develop dynamic languages to run on the . NET Framework and to add dynamic features to statically typed languages. Dynamic languages can identify the type of an object at run time, whereas in statically typed languages (without using the 'dynamic' keyword, specify object types at design time. The advantage here is - from the moment on the symbolic (and data Type) information is available from the ADS Device - Symbol/Variable values can be marshalled 'on-the-fly' during runtime in a type-safe manner. This works not only with primitive types but also with complex types. This reduces the complexity of the written application code to access the values, because neither the type of the data must be known, nor how the value data must be marshalled from/to the process image. The price to be paid is simply that the full symbolic information and data types must be downloaded from the ADS Device by the symbol loader. Example Automatic marshalling values with 'Dynamic Values' using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { uint value To Read = 0; uint value To Write = 42; client. Connect(Ams Net Id. Local, 851); // Load all Symbols + Data Types // Primitive Parts will be automatically resolved to . NET Primitive types. IDynamic Symbol Loader loader = (IDynamic Symbol Loader)Symbol Loader Factory. Create(client, Symbol Loa der Settings. Default Dynamic); dynamic symbols = loader. Symbols Dynamic; dynamic main = symbols. Main; // Use typed object to use Info Tips Dynamic Symbol n Counter = main.n Counter; // UDINT // or to be full Dynamic 26 Version: 1.1 TE1000
## Page 27

Concepts //dynamic n Counter = main.n Counter; // Works for ALL sorts of types (not restricted to ANY_TYPE basing primitive types) value To Read = (uint)n Counter. Read Value(); // or var var Value = n Counter. Read Value(); // or dynamic dyn Value = n Counter. Read Value(); // Same for writing n Counter. Write Value(value To Write); // Or Notifications / Events n Counter. Value Changed += NCounter_Value Changed; //Reading complex Types e.g. Struct Dynamic Symbol my Struct Symbol = main.plc Struct; // Dynamically created dynamic my Struct Val = my Struct Symbol. Read Value(); // Takes an ADS Snapshot of the value dynamic int1Val = my Struct Val.int1; // Value to an INT (short) dynamic value Nested Struct = my Struct Val.nested Struct; // value to another complex type (here a nested Struct) my Struct Symbol. Value Changed += My Struct Symbol_Value Changed; } Automatic marshalling values with 'Dynamic Values' private void NCounter_Value Changed(object sender, Value Changed Args e) { var uint Val = e. Value; } private void My Struct Symbol_Value Changed(object sender, Value Changed Args e) { dynamic struct Value = e. Value; // Snapshot of the whole Struct and all its contents } Calling 'Read Value' or the 'Value Changed' notification takes a full snapshot (with snapshot time) of the value. That means, when for example subelements of a struct value will be accessed, all subvalues will represent the value of that snapshot time consistently. Starting point is always the 'Dynamic Symbol' object that called 'Read Value'. An update of the value can be done directly on the value with 'Update Value', or with reading a new Value on the 'Dynamic Symbol' ('Read Value'). The 'Value Changed' event on the 'Dynamic Symbol' assigns a Notification for just this symbol. The 'Value Changed' Handler will contain the value completely marshalled as dynamic object. 4.8 Reactive Extensions and ADS The Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a . NET library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators. Using Rx, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using LINQ operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, Rx = Observables + LINQ + Schedulers. In ADS terms, not only the reading and writing data or symbol values can be put into reactive data streams, also ADS Notifications are a perfect fit for reactive code. This eases not only data binding to reactive frameworks (e.g. reactive UI) but also supports enhanced data manipulation via synchronous and asynchronous observers. Multithreaded and parallized code paths that support multiple CPU cores can be written very easily without the burden of deadlock and synchronization issues. More about . NET reactive extensions can be read here: Reactive extensions project site. The Twin CAT ADS Reactive extensions are available via a supplement Nuget Package: Beckhoff. Twin CAT. Ads.

NET API Documentation [} 14] 5.1 Read/Write primitive values Reading writing Values from ADS Devices is the most essential part of the communication API. There are several options for communication with your application. • Accessing by Index Group / Index Offset • Symbolic access by instance path and optionally use handles for the symbol • Holding the overall Symbolic information in the Symbol Loader and use easy access via symbol objects. • Usage the symbolic interface ITc Ads Symbol when complete Symbol Loading by Symbol Loaders is not appropriate. • Reading / Writing values as . NET managed Types (primitive types or compound primitive types called ANY_TYPES), or complex dynamic types typesafe generated at runtime. The following section shows the different scenarios as code snippets. How To Read/Write Values Read/Write Any Type by Index Group/Index Offset using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { UInt32 value To Read = 0; UInt32 value To Write = 42; client.

Write Value(value To Write); value To Read = (uint)n Counter. Read Value(); } 5.2 Read/Write string types ADS Server usually support strings in 2 flavors. The Default (ANSI) and the Unicode encoding (STRING vs. WSTRING) The ANSI encoding reserves 1 byte per character. Unicode reserves 2. The strings are of fixed size and therefore the length of the the reserved space within the process image is important. How To Read/Write string values Reading writing ANSI Streams: Read/Write ANSI Strings using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { client. Connect(851); // Connect to local port 851 (PLC) int handle = client. Create Variable Handle("MAIN.string"); // Symbol "string" in MAIN defined as s tring try { // Read ANSI String string[80] int byte Size = 81; // Size of 80 ANSI chars + /0 (STRING[80]) Ads Stream read Stream = new Ads Stream(byte Size); // Size of 80 ANSI chars + /0 (STRING[80]) Ads Binary Reader reader = new Ads Binary Reader(read Stream); client.

Position; int length = (int)e. Data Stream. Length; e. Data Stream. Position = offset; Ads Binary Reader reader = new Ads Binary Reader(e. Data Stream); // Read the Unmarshalled data //byte[] data = reader. Read Bytes(length); // Or here we know about UDINT type --> can be marshalled as UINT32 uint n Counter = reader. Read UInt32(); } 5.5 Reactive Read/Write with Reactive Extensions Observation of Notifications Notifications (address specified by Instance Path) will be received cyclically as defined in Default [} 637] and put into the Observer pipeline for further processing. This example takes 20 Notification samples before returning. Observe for Notifications // To Test the Observer run a project on the local PLC System (Port 851) using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { // Connect to target client. Connect(new Ams Address(Ams Net Id. Local, 851)); // Reactive Notification Handler var value Observer = Observer. Create<ushort>(val => { Console. Write Line(string. Format("Value: {0}", val. To String())); } ); // Turning ADS Notifications into sequences of Value Objects (Taking 20 Values) // and subscribe to them. IDisposable subscription = client. When Notification<ushort>("Twin CAT_System Info Var List._Task Info. Cycle Count", Notification Settings. Default). Take(20). Subscribe(value Observer); Console. Read Key(); // Wait for Key press subscription. Dispose(); // Dispose the Subscription } TE1000 Version: 1.1 35

Basic Samples Observation of Symbolic Notifications This example determines a symbol via Symbolloader and samples its values by Notifications with customized Notification Settings [} 634]. Again 20 samples are taken before the Observation finishes. Observe for Symbol Notifications // To Test the Observer run a project on the local PLC System (Port 851) using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { // Connect to target client. Connect(new Ams Address(Ams Net Id. Local, 851)); // Create Symbol information var symbol Loader = Symbol Loader Factory. Create(client, Symbol Loader Settings.

Basic Samples Console. Read Key(); // Wait for Key press subscription. Dispose(); // Dispose the Subscription } Polling observer A polling observer doesn't use ADS notifications, but instead the value read is triggered by a time interval (polling) or a customized trigger function (on request). Polling observer // To Test the Observer run a project on the local PLC System (Port 851) using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { // Connect to target client. Connect(new Ams Address(Ams Net Id. Local, 851)); // Create Symbol information var symbol Loader = Symbol Loader Factory. Create(client, Symbol Loader Settings.

Read Key(); // Wait for Key press subscription. Dispose(); // Dispose the Subscription } Writing values with observable subject In this example, a symbolic value is written in a static time interval (1 second). The writing stops after 10 values. The Write Values [} 969] extension method can be used to seamlessly bind value writing into a reactive application. Writing values with observable subject using (Tc Ads Client client = new Tc Ads Client()) { // Connect to target client. Connect(new Ams Address(Ams Net Id.

Return Value Type: IAds Symbol Loader [} 1072] The IAds Symbol Loader [} 1072] interface of the Symbol loader. Exceptions Exception Condition Object Disposed Exception Object Disposed Exception Remarks The Symbol Loader (V2) supports the following modes [} 119]. Flat [} 119]The flat mode organizes the Symbols in a flat list. At the beginning this List caches only the root symbol objects, which can be enumerated. To access the sub elements like structure fields or array elements use the Sub Symbols [} 1866] collection. The property get accessor generates the subsymbols lazy on the fly (performance optimized) and stores them internally as weak reference (memory optimized). This mode is available in all . NET versions. Virtual Tree [} 119]On top of the behaviour of the Flat [} 119], the virtual tree mode organizes the Symbols hierarchically with parent-child relationships. That eases the access to the hierarchical structure but needs slightly more preprocessing of the data. This mode is available in all . NET Versions. Dynamic Tree [} 119]The Dynamic tree mode organizes the Symbols hierarchically and (dynamically) creates struct members, array elements and enum fields on the fly. 'Dynamically' means here not only lazy creation like in Flat [} 119], but furthermore real creation of type safe . NET complex types/instances as represetantives of the Twin CAT Symbol objects/types. This feature is only available on platforms that support the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR); actually all . NET Framework Version larger than 4.0. Virtual instances means, that all Symbols are ordered within a tree structure. For that symbol nodes that are not located on a fixed address, a Virtual Symbol will be created. Setting the virtual Instance parameter to 'false' means, that the located symbols will be returned in a flattened list. Examples The following sample shows how to create a dynamic version of the Symbol Loader V2. The dynamic symbol loader makes use of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) of the . NET Framework. That means Structures, Arrays and Enumeration types and instances are generated 'on-the-fly' during symbol Browsing. These created dynamic objects are a one to one representation of the Symbol Server target objects (e.g the IEC61131 types on the PLC). Dynamic language features are only available from . NET4 upwards. Dynamic Tree Mode namespace Sample { using System; using System. Diagnostics; using System. Threading; using Twin CAT; using Twin CAT. Ads; 222 Version: 1.1 TE1000

The static symbol loader in version 2 is a nearly code compatible version of the Dynamic Loader, only the dynamic creation of objects is not available. The reason for supporting this mode is that . NET Framework Versions lower than Version 4.0 (CLR2) doesn't support the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). The Symbol Loader V2 static object is supported from . NET 2.0 on.

Polling is used from the User Application to read values, before they are fired as Notifications. Client side triggering has the following consequences: • The realtime environment on the server side will be less stressed (expecially the mailbox queue). • Value requests are serialized one after another and are handled slower (synchronouly, not asynchronously) • Implicit synchronization of the events into the UI Thread. Client On Change 2 The Ads Notification [} 848] event is fired when data changes triggered by the client. The Ads Notification [} 848] event is fired on-change triggered from the client side.

Twin CAT. Ads Namespaces Member name Value Description Cyclic 3 The Ads Notification [} 848] event is fired cyclically. The Notification will be registered on the ADS Server side for a cyclical trigger (dependant on time parameter) and is bound to the 'default' task of the addressed target. In case of the PLC target (e.g. Port 851) the default task is the first configured task. Each time the 'default' task has finished its cycle the realtime system will check for the expired cycle time and sends the Ads Notification [} 848] message on expiry. The used Context Mask for the 'default' task is 0. Please be aware, that server side 'Change' notifications stress the realtime system and should be handled with care. Therefore, dependent of the cycle time of the task and the capabilities of the system only a limited set of Cyclic Notifications should be used! A system limit for server side notification registrations is 1024. On Change 4 On-Change Ads Notification [} 848] event. The Notification will be registered on the ADS Server side for an on- change and optional cyclical trigger (dependant on parameters) and is bound to the 'default' task of the addressed target. In case of the PLC target (e.g. Port 851) the default task is the first configured task. Each time this task has finished its cycle the realtime system will check for the changed value and an optional expired cycle time and sends the Ads Notification [} 848] message on change or expiry. The used Context Mask for the 'default' task is 0. Please be aware, that server side 'On Change' notifications stress the realtime system / the default task with value comparisons. Therefore, dependent of the cycle time of the task and the capabilities of the system a higher amount of notification registrations should be handled with care ! A system limit for server side notification registrations is 1024. TE1000 Version: 1.1 441
## Page 442

Twin CAT. Ads Namespaces Member name Value Description Cyclic In Context 5 The Ads Notification [} 848] event is fired cyclically within the given task context. A Value of parameter is interpreted as task context number Context Mask [} 614]. This can be important, if the notifications have to be synchron with specific tasks, but should not be used in the default case. The Notification will be registered on the ADS Server side for a cyclical trigger (dependant on time parameter) and is bound to the task specified by the Context Mask of the addressed target. In case of the PLC target (e.g. Port 851) the Context Mask is the Index of the global TASKINFOARRAY - 1. Each time this task has finished its cycle the realtime system will check for the expired cycle time and sends the Ads Notification [} 848] message on expiry. On Change In Context 6 The Ads Notification [} 848] event is fired when the data changes within the given task context. A Value of parameter is interpreted as task context number Context Mask [} 614]. This can be important, if the notifications have to be synchron with specific tasks, but should not be used in the default case. The Notification will be registered on the ADS Server side for an on- change and optional cyclical trigger (dependant on parameters) and is bound to the task specified by the Context Mask of the addressed target. In case of the PLC target (e.g. Port 851) the Context Mask is the Index of the global TASKINFOARRAY - 1. Each time this task has finished its cycle the realtime system will check for the changed value and an optional expired cycle time and sends the Ads Notification [} 848] message on change or expiry. Please be aware, that server side 'On Change' notifications stress the realtime system / the default task with value comparisons. Therefore, dependent of the cycle time of the task and the capabilities of the system only a limited set of On Change Notifications should be used! 442 Version: 1.1 TE1000

Twin CAT. Ads Namespaces Remarks The Ads Trans Mode configures the registration of the Ads Notification [} 848] at the server system and how the parameters of the Add Device Notification(String, Ads Stream, Int32, Int32, Ads Trans Mode, Int32, Int32, Object) [} 735] are interpreted. The following general scenarios are addressed: • Cyclic notifications. • Notifications on value change. • Server side and Client side notifications. • Binding of notifications to specific tasks. In the default case the On Change or the Cyclic (Server cycle) should be used. All other modes are side cases for special purposes. More about the Ads Notifications: ADS Notification concept [} 20].

Remarks The settings typically can be used for polling clients, where the "Fail Fast" feature will be bypassed. That means, that communication fails doesn't trigger the Fail Fast interceptor and every Request will go out via ADS. This has the Drawback that communication Timeouts are longer and subsequent timeouts block the ADS mailbox (with the danger of overflows). So use this setting with care for specific purposes and should not be used for standard communication. • No Resurrection time and therefore: • No Fail Fast Handler [} 575] active. • Default communication timeout 200ms. • Not synchronized Notifications.

The reason for this timeout is not to flood the ADS mailbox with requests that cannot be handled by the ethernet infrastructure.

Twin CAT. Ads Namespaces Property Value Type: Boolean Remarks IMPORTANT: Be aware that this setting could be removed in later version of this API. The default setting changed from 'true' to 'false' in newer versions, because synchronization should be done in the Application and not has helper functionality within this class / API. Please think about of using . NET Synchronization Contexts or Control. Invoke(...) calls for Application side synchronization. If Synchronize is set to true, the notifications are synchronized onto the Main thread. This is helpful for Windows Forms projects because this automatically synchronizes the notifications into the main UI thread and prevents any synchronization issues like deadlocks. In Console Applications it is necessary to set this flag to false if ADS notifications are used, because the Console Host doesn't trigger any message pumps, effectively blocking any Windows Messages and ADS Notifications.

Using Rx, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using LINQ operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, Rx = Observables + LINQ + Schedulers. The ADS reactive extensions are build on top of this library to enable ADS Symbol and State Observables, seamlessly bound to the reactive extensions. To use the ADS reactive extensions the Twin CAT. Ads. Reactive Nuget package (or the included Twin CAT. Ads. Reactive.dll) must be referenced. (Beckhoff. Twin CAT. Ads. Reactive package on Nuget).

Using Rx, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using LINQ operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, Rx = Observables + LINQ + Schedulers. The ADS reactive extensions are build on top of this library to enable ADS Symbol and State 914 Version: 1.1 TE1000

Using Rx, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using LINQ operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, Rx = Observables + LINQ + Schedulers. The ADS reactive extensions are build on top of this library to enable ADS Symbol and State Observables, seamlessly bound to the reactive extensions.

Succeeded [} 978] Gets a value indicating whether this ISum Command is succeeded. Remarks ADS offers powerful and fast communication to exchange any kind of information. It's possible to read single variables or complete arrays and structures with each one single ADS-API call. The ADS Sum Command command offers to read with one singale ADS call multiple variables which are not structured within a linear memory. As a result the ADS caller application (like scada Systems etc.) can extremly speed up cyclic polling : Sample : • Until now : Polling 4000 single variables which are not in a linear area (like array / structure / fixed PLC address ) would cause 4000 single Ads-Read Req with each 1-2 ms protocol time. As a result the scanning of these variables take 4000ms-8000ms. • New Ads-Command allows to read multiple variables with one single ADS-Read Req : 4000 single variables are handled with e.g. 8 single Ads-Read Req (each call requesting 500 variables) with each 1-2 ms protocol time. As a result the scanning of these variables take just few 10ms. REQUIREMENTS AND IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ADS is just a transport layer, but there could be important side effects. So read this requirements and take care on limitations: • Version of target ADS Device - ADS itself is just the transport layer, but the requested ADS de- vice has to support the ADS-Command. • Bytes length of requested data - Requesting a large list of values from variables is fine, but the requested data of the Ads-response (the data-byte-length) have to pass the AMS Router (size by default a 2048kb) So the caller has to limit the requested variables based on calculation of re- quested data-byte-length. • Number of Sub-ADS calls : Highly recommended to max. 500 ! - If the PLC is processing one ADS request, it will completely work on this single ADS request BEFORE starting neyt PLC cy- cle. As a result one single ADS request with 200.000 sub-Ads-requests would cause that PLC would collect and copy 200.000 variables into one single ADS response, before starting next PLC. So this large number of ads-sub-commands will jitter the PLC execution ! We highly rec- ommend to not request more than 500 Ads-Sub commands Reference Twin CAT. Ads.

Twin CAT. Ads Namespaces Remarks This is an ADS Sum Command to access values by handle information. It is always used in combination with and . By design (and in contrast to the symbolic access in Sum Symbol Read [} 995], Sum Symbol Write [} 1000]) this access method can act only with ADS ANY Type (Primitive) values (disadvantage). The Advantage is, that no symbolic information must be loaded before accessing the values, see samples: Examples Usage of Sum commands with handles (Create Handles, Read, Write, Release Handles) /// <summary> /// Defines the entry point of the application. /// </summary> /// <param name="args">The arguments.</param> static void Main(string[] args) { Console.

Return Value Type: ISymbol Loader [} 1872] ISymbol Loader. Examples The following sample shows how to create a dynamic version of the Symbol Loader V2. The dynamic symbol loader makes use of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) of the . NET Framework. That means Structures, Arrays and Enumeration types and instances are generated 'on-the-fly' during symbol Browsing. These created dynamic objects are a one to one representation of the Symbol Server target objects (e.g the IEC61131 types on the PLC). Dynamic language features are only available from .

The static symbol loader in version 2 is a nearly code compatible version of the Dynamic Loader, only the dynamic creation of objects is not available. The reason for supporting this mode is that . NET Framework Versions lower than Version 4.0 (CLR2) doesn't support the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). The Symbol Loader V2 static object is supported from . NET 2.0 on.

Dynamic. Set Member Binder Provides information about the object that called the dynamic operation. The binder. Name property provides the name of the member to which the value is being assigned. For example, for the statement sample Object. Sample Property = "Test", where sample Object is an instance of the class derived from the Dynamic Object class, binder. Name returns "Sample Property". The binder. Ignore Case property specifies whether the member name is case- sensitive. value Type: System. Object The value to set to the member. For example, for sample Object.

Twin CAT. Ads Namespaces VB Public Overrides Function Try Set Member ( binder As Set Member Binder, value As Object ) As Boolean Parameters binder Type: System. Dynamic. Set Member Binder Provides information about the object that called the dynamic operation. The binder. Name property provides the name of the member to which the value is being assigned. For example, for the statement sample Object. Sample Property = "Test", where sample Object is an instance of the class derived from the Dynamic Object class, binder. Name returns "Sample Property". The binder. Ignore Case property specifies whether the member name is case- sensitive. value Type: System. Object The value to set to the member. For example, for sample Object. Sample Property = "Test", where sample Object is an instance of the class derived from the Dynamic Object class, the value is "Test". Return Value Type: Boolean true if the operation is successful; otherwise, false. If this method returns false, the run-time binder of the language determines the behavior.
