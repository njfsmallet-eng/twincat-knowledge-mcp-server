Overview 1 Overview Task Software limit switches (SWE) limit the maximum travel distance of an axis. Properties The positions of the SWE can be configured for the following axis types: • Linear axes. • Rotary axes that are not operated as modulo axes SWE monitoring is only active if the axis • is referenced or • used with an absolute position measuring system (P-AXIS-00014). Parameterisation The positions of the SWE must be configured for each axis with P-AXIS-00177 and P-AXIS-00178. Programming The following applies concerning the validity of limit switch positions for all builds of V2.11.20xx and V2.11.28xx: • The limit value can be further restricted in the NC program by programming but cannot be increased. In other words, the limit value defined in the axis parameter list cannot be increased by G98. • In static axis constellations (without axis exchange) the limit value changed in the NC program first remains valid at program end and is also effective in the next NC program activated. Only after CNC reset followed by a program restart does the original default value become valid again. As of Build V3.1.3077.0 the following applies: • See description in Section “Supplements to G98 and G99” Mandatory note on references to other documents For the sake of clarity, links to other documents and parameters are abbreviated, e.g. [PROG] for the Programming Manual or P-AXIS-00001 for an axis parameter. For technical reasons, these links only function in the Online Help (HTML5, CHM) but not in pdf files since pdfs do not support cross-linking. 8 Version: 1.22 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Software limit switch

Description 2 Description Task Software limit switch monitoring (SLS monitoring) is used to monitor the command and actual positions of an axis. A positive SLS (P-AXIS-00178) and a negative SLS (P-AXIS-00177) can be configured for each axis. The positions of the SLS are always referred to the axis coordinate system. Condition The monitored axis must be referenced (G74) or P-AXIS-00014 must be configured. Effectiveness This is why a distinction is made between SLS monitoring based on the command value or actual value. • Command positions are checked for exact compliance with the SLS. • A tolerance of the actual position is configured for monitoring overshoots of SLS using P-AXIS-00179. This prevents the output of an error message in the event of negligible overshoots. Command position related software limit switch monitoring is executed during path preparation. In certain applications, the command position of axes is influenced by circumstances (e.g. gear coupling) that are unknown when planning contours. In these cases, the parameters P-AXIS-00520 and P-AXIS-00521 can be used in the position controller to activate the monitoring of command position values. The actual positions are always monitored in the position controller. Permissible actual positions Permissible command positions Axis position 0 Tolerance area for Tolerance area for actual positions actual positions Position of negativ Position of positiv software limit switch software limit switch Fig. 1: Position and effectiveness of the software limit switch Activation SLS monitoring of the command and actual positions of an axis is activated in all the operating modes available as soon as the axis is referenced. As of Build V3.1.3037.11 the parameter P-AXIS-00705 can be used to switch on/off the SLS monitoring feature irrespective of axis type or axis mode.

Description 2.1 Display motion path limiting The parameter P-CHAN-00489 [} 19] activates the display of motion path limiting. This transforms the active software limit switches of the axis coordinate system (ACS) into the programming coordinate system (PCS) in order to display them. All offsets are considered (e.g. zero point or tool offsets) and Cartesian transformations (#CS). The parameter P-CHAN-00434 must also be activated to include mirroring. A display of PCS limits is not possible for axes that are a component of an active kinematic transformation. The software limit switches continue to be monitoring at ACS level. The PCS data displayed provides information about the axis location relative to the software limit switch and the distance to go without reaching the software limit switch. This also applies to manual mode. When the parameter P-CHAN-00489 [} 19] is set, the CNC objects • Positive PCS limit [} 24] • Negative PCS limit [} 24] display the motion path limit in the PCS and the CNC objects • Distance to positive PCS limit [} 24] • Distance to negative PCS limit [} 24] display the distance to go to each path limit. 12 Version: 1.22 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Software limit switch

Programming 3 Programming 3.1 Programming a negative software limit switch Negative software limit switch The G98 command sets negative SLS in the programmed axes. • If G90 is active, the negative SLS is set absolute to the programmed value. • If G91 is active, the programmed value is added relative to P-AXIS-00177. G98 is active in each block; the software limit switches programmed using it are active cross-block. The positions for negative SLS programmed via G98 are stored in the axis-specific variables V. A. SWE. X, V. A. SWE. Y, V. A. SWE. Z, etc. [PROG]. The variables are pre-assigned the value of P-AXIS-00177 of each axis at a reset, mode change or axis change.

Programming 3.3 Extensions to G98 and G99 As of Build V3.1.3077.0, limit switch positions referenced to the limits specified in the axis parameter list can also be extended by G98 and. This permits a temporary change to an extended section within an NC program and back. The positive limits must continue to be greater than the negative limit. At the next NC program started or after a CNC reset, the configured default values will again a0pp0ly. The following applies in • automatic mode: When G98/G99 are programmed before the motion movement, the limited section compared to the configured setting can also be enlarged. • Manual mode: When G98/G99 are programmed before manual mode is activated,, the limited section compared to the configured setting can be extended: ◦ Relative offset limits P-AXIS-00137 and P-AXIS-00138. The new limit acts immediately when manual mode is activated. ◦ Absolute offset limits P-AXIS-00492 and P-AXIS-00493: These values are effective if they are entered in the axis parameter list !=0. They can then be set to the maximum configured limit switch positions (P-AXIS-00177, P-AXIS-00178). In this way, the axis cannot move beyond these limits in manual mode, even if the limits are extended by G98 and G99. However, these absolute manual mode limits can be adapted towards the new limit switch positions using CNC objects. The parameter P-CHAN-00498 [} 19] (as of Build V3.1.3080.4) sets the limit behaviour. When P- CHAN-00498 [} 19] is set, it is prohibited to extend the limit.

Parameter Description This parameter defines the limitation behaviour for programming software limits switches in the NC program using G98 and G99. As of CNC Build V3.1.3077.0 it is permitted to increase the range of the software limits switches in the NC program.

Description Command position related software limit switch monitoring is executed during path preparation. This ensures that a programmed movement that crosses a software limit switch is not executed. In certain situations the command position is influenced by circumstances that are not known in the path preparation process and can thus not be detected in the software limit switch operation of the path planning process. Examples for this are the use of the external command position interface on the HLI or axis couplings via the HLI (see HLI or [FCT-A9]). With both these parameters (P-AXIS-00520 and P-AXIS-00521 [} 22]), the position command values of the axis can be monitored in the position controller. When monitoring is active, a check is made in every interpolation cycle that the axis can stop from their current velocity before the software limit switch when it is decelerated with P-AXIS-00003. The software limits used are the actual values of the software limit switches without considering the software limit switch tolerance (P-AXIS-00179). If the software limit switch is crossed, error message ID 70195 is output and the axis is stopped.
