Overview of clamp position offset parameter Overview of clamp position offset parameter The clamp position offset data is sorted into a 4-column table. • Column 1 contains the unambiguous identifier of the clamp position offset parameter called the “ID” which consists of the prefix “P-CLMP” and a unique 5-digit number, e.g. P-CLMP-00001. • Column 2 represents the data structure which defines the parameter, e.g. pzv_grp[i].achse[j]. The structure is a categorisation aid and is described in the following section. • Column 3 contains the “parameter” with its exact description, e.g. offset. The important thing is that “structure”+”parameter” always belong together and must therefore be configured in exactly the same way in the clamp position offset parameter list, e.g. pzv_grp[i].achse[j].versatz • Column 4 contains the “functionality” in a summarised term/short description, e.g. axis-specific clamp position offset. ID Structure Parameter Functionality/short description P-CLMP-00001 [} 11] pzv_grp[i].achse[j]. offset Axis-specific clamp position offset TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.16 7 Clamp position offsets

General description 1 General description 1.1 Links to other documents For the sake of clarity, links to other documents and parameters are abbreviated, e.g. [PROG] for the Programming Manual or P-AXIS-00001 for an axis parameter. For technical reasons these links only function in the Online Help (HTML5, CHM) but not in pdf files since pdfs do not support cross-linking. 1.2 Classification of clamp position offset data Clamp position offsets can be defined in different groups in the clamp position offset data list. The required clamp position offset group can be loaded by selecting the clamp position offset index before program start- up. Each clamp position offset group contains the clamp position offset data for all path axes and is generally referred to below as clamp position offset. The clamp position offset data is included in the coordinates of all path axes at program start-up. The axis index corresponds to the channel-internal axis index. The initial axis configuration of the NC channel is defines in the channel parameters [CHAN// Section: Configuration of path axes]. Value ranges of parameters may also be defined by stating a limit resulting from data width, e.g. MAX(UNS32), etc. 1.3 Syntax and interpretation of ASCII list file An interpreter copies the entries in the ASCII list file into identical internal structures which are then checked for plausibility. To ensure reliable controller start-up every time, any defective entries found by the plausibility check are replaced by default values. Unknown entries are not taken over. These irregularities are displayed by warning messages. We advise you to investigate the cause for these warning messages and remove defective entries from the ASCII list file. The following agreement applies to BOOLEAN data: Value Meaning 0 Definition of FALSE 1 Definition of TRUE The following agreement applies to STRING data: If a character string containing characters with a special meaning in ASCII lists (e.g. comment characters, spaces [} 10]) is assigned to a STRING type list parameter, this character string must be defined in inverted commas ″..″ (available as of V3.1.3081.0, V3.1.3108.0). example[0].name ″STRING_WITH_COMMENT( # /*)_CHARACTERS″ Trailing spaces are discarded on import. The entry.. example[0].name ″STRING_WITH_POST_SPACES ″ ..has the same meaning as example[0].name ″STRING_WITH_POST_SPACES″ 8 Version: 1.16 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Clamp position offsets

General description 1.4 Comments in the ASCII list file Comments can be in an entire line or can be added at the end of a line. With a comment spanning an entire line, the comment character "'#" must be placed at the start of the line and followed by a blank. If a comment is to be inserted at the end of a line, only a blank is required before the comment. Blank lines are also possible. Comments in the ASCII list file # ************************************************************************ # Data # ************************************************************************ # # List comments after numerical values dummy[1] 1 Comment dummy[2] 1 # Comment dummy[3] 1 ( Comment dummy[4] 1 /* Comment ... ... However, if a character string was assigned to the list parameter as a value in the line, any following comment must be opened by a bracket '('. The comment characters space, # and /* are not permitted. If a '(' itself is part of the character string, the character string must be defined in inverted commas ″..″ (available as of V3.1.3081.0, V3.1.3108.0). # List comments after strings beispiel[0].bezeichnung STRING_1 (comment requires a '(‘ bracket!) beispiel[1].bezeichnung″ STRING_(2)″ (comment requires a '(‘ bracket!) 10 Version: 1.16 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Clamp position offsets

Description of elements 2 Description of elements 2.1 Clamp position offset group (pzv_grp[i].*) Each clamp position offset group "pzv_grp[i]" contains the clamp position offsets for all path axes. Before program start-up, a clamp position offset group can be selected from the operating menu. Structure name Index pzv_grp[i] i = 0 ... 149 (maximum number of clamp position offset groups: 150, application- specific) 2.1.1 Axis assignment of data in the clamp position offset group (pzv_grp[i].achse[j.*]) This structure element assigns clamp position offsets to path axes. The axis index corresponds to the channel-internal axis index. Structure name Index achse[j] j = 0 ... 31 (maximum number of axes per channel: 32, application-specific) 2.1.1.1 Axis-specific clamp position offset (P-CLMP-00001) P-CLMP-00001 Axis-specific clamp position offset Description An offset parameter is reserved for each axis in each clamp position offset group. Parameter pzv_grp[i].achse[j].versatz Data type SGN32 Data range MIN(SGN32) ≤ versatz ≤ MAX(SGN32) Dimension 0.1µm or 0.0001° Default value 0 Remarks TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.16 11 Clamp position offsets
