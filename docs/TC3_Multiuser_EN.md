Installation 2 Installation As of Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 the installation of Twin CAT Multiuser is required. All earlier versions of Twin CAT 3 include Twin CAT Multiuser as part of the standard installation. Twin CAT Multiuser is installed via the Twin CAT Package Manager. Further information on this can be found in the installation documentation. You can perform the installation using either the user interface (UI) or the command line interface (CLI). You can use the UI to display all available workloads and install them as needed. To do this, follow the corresponding instructions in the interface. You can use the following command to display the available workloads on the system in the CLI: tcpkg list -t workload Explanations on installation via CLI can be found in the chapter Working with the command line. When referring to the Twin CAT Multiuser installation in the following, a distinction is made between PCs with Twin CAT Engineering and systems with Twin CAT Runtime only. On a PC with Engineering or with Engineering and Runtime If Twin CAT Engineering and Twin CAT Runtime or only Twin CAT Engineering are installed on your system, install both Multiuser Editor and Multiuser Server. To do this, choose the following two workloads in the Twin CAT Package Manager UI: • Twin CAT Multiuser - Engineering • Twin CAT Multiuser – Runtime Or install the workloads via the CLI using the following commands: tcpkg install Twin CAT. Multiuser. XAE tcpkg install Twin CAT. Multiuser. XAR Multiuser Editor and Multiuser Server are installed. 8 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

## Page 9

Installation On a runtime PC Multiuser Server can be used on a runtime-only PC without Visual Studio. In this case, receiving the data and populating the GIT repository is handled by a simplified implementation of the Git commands on the server which maps the minimum requirements for exchange with the engineering system. Customers who wish to use the full Git functionality in combination with the Multiuser Server are advised to install Git first and then the XAR workload for the Multiuser Server component. GIT installation: 1. Open the download page on the official GIT website: https://git-scm.com/download/win 2. Depending on your system architecture, choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit version to download. 3. Perform the installation. If possible, do not change the installation path, as Multiuser Server expects GIT in a defined path. If the change is still necessary, the corresponding path must be added to the server’s gitpath.config file at C:\Program Files (x86)\Beckhoff\Twin CAT\Functions\Multiuser\Tc Ads Git Server Multiuser installation: Select the following workload in the Twin CAT Package Manager UI: • Twin CAT Multiuser – Runtime Or use the following command to install the workload via CLI: tcpkg install Twin CAT. Multiuser. XAR Multiuser Server is installed. TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 9

Concept 3 Concept More and more machine and system functions are implemented in software. To allow for this, nowadays teams of several programmers are involved in creating the control code and subsequently the commissioning of these machines and systems. This poses several challenges, especially during commissioning: • In many cases, access to Source Control Systems is not guaranteed. • The latest (active) software version on the machine may differ from the local version. • If changes that are "downloaded" to the target system turn out to be incorrect, it is not possible to undo the "download". Twin CAT Multiuser was developed to meet these challenges. This is a "local" Source Control System on the target system, the handling of which has been fully integrated into the existing workflow. This means that no in-depth knowledge of the exact functionality of Source Control Systems is required to use Twin CAT Multiuser. Twin CAT Multiuser is available from version TC3.1.4024.0. In this version, Twin CAT Multiuser mainly facilitates collaboration of several programmers, with each programmer working on one PLC project. If several PLC projects are integrated in a Twin CAT project, the multiuser functionality can be enabled separately for each project. In this case, separate repositories are automatically created for each of these projects, both locally and on the target system. Since version 3.1.4024.4.0, complete Twin CAT projects can also be managed with the multiuser function. It can now be selected in the settings whether complete Twin CAT projects or only individual PLC projects are managed by the multiuser function. The following diagram illustrates the concept: The target system is selected as the Source Control Server during commissioning, since a connection to the target system is required in any case in order to load a control program onto the target system. This avoids the need for additional infrastructure. Another objective of multiuser integration is to avoid the need for specific Source Control knowledge. The Source Control functionality is integrated in the standard workflow. For example, the current project status is automatically transferred to the target system during a download or online change of a project, without the 10 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

## Page 11

Concept need to trigger the transfer separately. The history is also created automatically. All changes are recorded, including user name, timestamp and change. If required, a query for a comment can be set for each change transfer. To ensure that the history created in this way continues to be available after commissioning, a Source Control System was integrated, which permits several repositories and also transfers the full history into all repositories. After successful commissioning, it is thus possible to transfer the active project status of the machine/system to a "development repository", including traceability of all steps performed during commissioning. The latter is done with the on-board resources of the Source Control System. The Source Control System on which the multiuser functionality is based is Git. NOTICE The Twin CAT 3 Multiuser function uses Git Git itself is separate and is installed optionally. If a standard Git installation is available on a computer, this can be used for the Twin CAT 3 Multiuser function (see Reference server settings [} 29]). The Twin CAT 3 Installer allows customers who do not have a Git installation on the computer to install a Min Git that is only intended for use from Twin CAT 3 Multiuser and therefore is not entered in the Path environment variable. Differentiation from the Source Control Integration of Twin CAT: The general interfacing of Twin CAT with Source Control Systems remains unaffected by the multiuser functionality and can take place independently of it. By using the standard interface of the Microsoft Visual Studio Shell integrated in Twin CAT, a large number of Source Control Systems are available for this purpose. In addition, all aspects of a Twin CAT project can be handled by this integration. The Twin CAT multiuser functionality is based on the Git standard. As already described, the aim of this functionality is to enable a team of several programmers to collaborate on a control program during the commissioning phase, without the need for a special infrastructure or special knowledge of Source Control Systems on the part of the programmers. Although it is therefore possible to use different Source Control Systems for both functionalities, the full capabilities can only be achieved if both functionalities are based on Git. This refers to the transfer of the history during commissioning to the "main" Source Control System. TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 11

Click the Init button. ð The Settings tab of the Multiuser Explorer opens automatically. 2. In the ADS Route field, select the target system that contains the multiuser repository. 3. In the Multiuser Repository combo box, select the name of the multiuser repository to which the project is to be linked. 4. If required, select the option Ask for update message on each usage. (See also Settings tab [} 19].) 5. Click the Init local and remote button. ð The multiuser repository in the Twin CAT project is now initialized. 4.2 Management of a Twin CAT 3 PLC project 4.2.1 Activating the multiuser function for a PLC project To activate this function for a PLC project that is not yet managed through the multiuser functionality, carry out the following steps: 1. Activate the Use Multiuser option in the project settings of the PLC project that is to be managed through the multiuser functionality. (See PLC project settings [} 27]) 2. Click the Init button to make the settings for the multiuser function and initialize the function. ð The Settings tab of the Multiuser Explorer window opens automatically. If you close the window by mistake, you can find it under the menu Twin CAT -> Multiuser Explorer. 3. In the ADS Route field, select a target system for the multiuser repository. 4. In the Multiuser Repository field, select a name for the multiuser repository. 5. If required, select the option Ask for update message on each usage. (See also Settings tab [} 19]) 6. Click the Init local and remote button. ð The multiuser repositories in the project and on the target system are initialized. 1. Click the button Init once again so that the URL of the multiuser repository is stored in the project. ð If the URL is stored directly in the project, this facilitates local initialization for this project on additional systems. Also see about this 2 Reference project settings [} 27] 4.2.2 Use of an already set up PLC project on another system If an existing PLC project is to be linked to the multiuser server for which a repository has already been set up on the target system, proceed as follows: 1. Open the project. 2. In the project settings of the PLC project that is to be managed by the multiuser functionality, check whether the option Use Multiuser (see Reference project settings [} 27]) is activated and the multiuser URL is stored in the project. ð Depending on whether the multiuser URL is stored in the Twin CAT project, the further procedure differs. ü The multiuser URL is stored in the project. 1. Click the Init button to initialize the multiuser function locally. 14 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

## Page 15

Workflow ð The following dialog opens. 2. Click the Init local multiuser button. ð The multiuser function is now initialized locally for the PLC project and can be used. ü The multiuser URL is not stored in the project: 1. Click the Init button. ð The Settings tab of the Multiuser Explorer opens automatically. 2. In the ADS Route field, select the target system that contains the multiuser repository. 3. In the Multiuser Repository combo box, select the name of the multiuser repository to which the project is to be linked. 4. If required, select the option Ask for update message on each usage. (See also Settings tab [} 19]) 5. Click the Init local and remote button. ð The multiuser repository in the project is now initialized. If you do not have an existing project, you can create a Twin CAT project. Add an empty PLC project and link it to the multiuser repository on the target system as described above. Git uses absolute paths in the repository The Git Source Control System uses absolute paths in the repositories. This means that copying a project in which multiuser functionality is already installed (including the . Tc Git folder) will result in the multiuser functionality not working correctly. 4.3 Working with set functionality If the multiuser functionality has been set up as described in the previous chapters, this functionality integrates automatically into the existing workflow. Transferring the data to the target repository The changes generated while working on the project are automatically transferred to the target repository during an Activate, Download or Online Change if multiuser functionality is activated. TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 15

## Page 16

Workflow Checks are carried out to ascertain whether there is a conflict with the data in the target repository. This is the case if other programmers working on the project have already made changes to the same project parts (e.g. POUs, settings etc.) and transferred them to the target repository. If there is a conflict, it is displayed in the following dialog. In this selection dialog you then have the option to • resolve the conflicts using the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool, • force an update of the target system including the target repository, or • cancel the Activate, Download or Login. The Force Update button can be used if the target system is required to run with the current project without taking into account the changes made by the other programmers involved in the project. There is no synchronisation with the multiuser repository. Once the project is running, the synchronisation with the multiuser repository must be done manually at a later time (see Manual tab [} 25]). The normal workflow for collaborating on a project involves resolving conflicts. In this step, you can merge the changes you have made to the project with those of the other programmers working on the project. 1. To do this, click Solve Conflict. ð The Conflict tab now opens. This allows you to discard all your local changes and apply the version from the target repository, or to merge the two versions. 2. To merge the versions, click Merge Local and Remote. 16 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

## Page 17

Workflow ð The subsequent overview shows you all files (e.g. POUs (Programming Organization Unit)) where changes have led to conflicts with the target repository. 3. For each conflict displayed, click Start Merge. ð The Twin CAT Project Compare Tool opens, in which you can merge the changes. 4. Accept the result with Accept. ð If the merge is confirmed in the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool and the tool is closed, the accept of the merge takes place automatically from Twin CAT version 3.1.4024.40 onwards. If you want to accept the changes directly, confirm it with the Accept button. Proceed in the same way in the previous Twin CAT versions. ð Once all changes have been merged, you are notified that there are no further conflicts. 5. Now perform an Activate, Download or Login again. ð The current and merged version of the project is transferred to the target system and stored in the target repository. No simultaneous changes by multiple programmers Simultaneous changes by several programmers are not possible. Although several programmers can be logged into the target system at the same time to view the project status, only one programmer can make changes at any one time. All other programmers have to log out. The logged-in programmers are shown in the following dialog. TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 17

## Page 18

Workflow Once the changes have been made, the other programmers can log in again and the workflow shown above is triggered to merge the changes with those of the other programmers. If the other programmers have not yet made any further changes to the project, they are notified that a newer version is available on the remote system. 18 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

Reference user interface 5 Reference user interface The Multiuser Explorer is the central administration tool for the multiuser functionality. This window remains empty as long as no project has been associated with multiuser functionality. Using the Clone button, the status of the project can be retrieved from the target system repository on an engineering system and stored locally. Once a project is selected, the tabs described in this chapter become visible. 5.1 Settings tab Once a project has been selected, the Settings tab appears as follows: • If the multiuser function is not yet initialized: TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 19

## Page 20

Reference user interface • If the multiuser function is already initialized: ADS Route Combo box for selecting an existing ADS route Multiuser repository Combo box for selecting an existing multiuser repository or creating a new one. Remote Multiuser URL URL for repository User name User name to be used for the entries in the history. The default setting is the placeholder "%Logged In User%“. This is automatically replaced by the locally logged in user as user name in the comment. Ask for update message on each usage Option to query change messages. Update message Structure of the update message The placeholders "%Action%", "%Files Changed%" and "%User Message%" are automatically replaced by the corresponding information during an online change or download. If a placeholder is removed, the corresponding information is removed from the automatically generated comment. Placeholder: "%Action%": indicates whether an online change or download was performed. "%Files Changes%" indicates the number and reason for the changed files (e.g. 2 added). "%User Message%" is replaced by the user-specific comment if the option Ask for update message on each usage is activated. Init local and remote Initializes the multiuser function with the selected settings. Save changes Saves the changes made to the settings. 5.2 History tab The History tab has a Show History button. This opens a tool window which shows the history of the current project. 20 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

## Page 21

Reference user interface Example: History of the documentation example. In this example, changes were made both on the target system and on the local system. 5.3 Changes tab The Changes tab shows all files where changes have been made that have not yet been transferred to the target repository. In the following image, exemplary changes have been made to the MAIN-POU (Program Organization Unit) of the Untiteld1 project. TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 21

## Page 22

Reference user interface Updating of the target system only in case of changes in the code Not every change displayed is a code change. The changes are only transferred to the target system if there is a change in the code that requires a new download of the project or project parts. Example: A change in a comment within a POU is a change within a file that does not require recompiling. For this reason, it is possible to log in without online change and thus without downloading the changes. 5.4 Conflict tab The Conflict tab shows whether there are any conflicts between the local status and the status in the target repository, or if a merge has been triggered. The following cases are possible: Local and target repositories have the same status: The local system contains changes that have not yet been transferred: 22 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

Environment Displays the state of the multiuser server: OK: local and target repository found. Local Not Exists: no local repository was found. Remote Not Exists: no target repository was found. Files Shows the status of the files: OK: local and target repository found, no newer project status on target repository. Local Not Exists: no local repository was found. Remote Not Exists: no target repository was found. Lokalsbehind Remote: a newer version exists on the target repository. Delete Multiuser files / Deactivate Deletes the local repository and deactivates multiuser functionality. Multiuser The Files status entry also displays OK if the local files status is newer than that in the repository. You can see which files have been changed in the Diff [} 21] tab. 5.6 Manual tab The Manual tab is used to write the current project status to the target system or to fetch it from there. Pull (override local) Fetches the current project status from the target system and overwrites the local project. There is no merge of the project statuses. Push (override remote) Overwrites the status on the target system. There is no merge of the project statuses. TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 25

Reference project settings 6 Reference project settings 6.1 Twin CAT project settings In order to have the Twin CAT project managed by the multiuser function, this function must be activated in the project settings. Use Multiuser Enables the multiuser functionality of the Twin CAT project. Multiuser URL Displays the URL of the remote/target system repository. Init Initializes the multiuser function for this Twin CAT project. Reuse of PLC projects The multiuser function is implemented in such a way that in a future version the Twin CAT project and the PLC projects can be managed independently of each other using the multiuser function. Especially in combination with Git as Source Control system during engineering, this offers some advantages if you want to reuse PLC projects in multiple projects. For this reason, it must be defined in the settings of the PLC projects whether they are managed with the overall project or separately. • Define in the settings of the PLC projects whether they are managed with the overall project or separately. (See PLC project settings [} 27]) 6.2 PLC project settings To use the multiuser function only in one PLC project, this function must be enabled in the PLC settings. TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 27

Reference project settings Use Multiuser Enables the multiuser functionality of the PLC project. Multiuser URL Displays the URL of the remote/target system repository. Init Initializes the multiuser function for this PLC project. Update Parent If the entire Twin CAT project is managed by the multiuser function, use this to activate that the Twin CAT project is informed about user activities that require an alignment of the repository (login, download). Manage Twin CAT project as a whole The current multiuser function can be used to manage either the entire Twin CAT project or the PLC project. Both are not yet possible, but will follow in a future version. If the entire Twin CAT project is managed, the multiuser function must not be switched on in the PLC, but only the Update Parent. In this state the Twin CAT project is informed about corresponding user actions, so that the update of the target system repository takes place from the Twin CAT project. • Activate the Update Parent. 28 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

Reference server settings 7 Reference server settings The Twin CAT 3 Multiuser function uses Git. Git itself is separate and is installed optionally, this is selectable during the Twin CAT 3 installation. If a standard Git installation is available on a computer, this can be used for the Twin CAT 3 Multiuser function. Changing the location of the Git repositories If necessary, you can change the default storage location of the Git repositories on the target system. The default location is "C:\Program Data\Beckhoff\Multiuser Repository". To adjust the path, change the entry in the file "<Twin CAT Folder>/Functions/Multiuser/directorypath.config" so that it points to the desired path. TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 29

FAQ 8 FAQ The multiuser function is behaving in a way that is not described. What can I do? The status of the multiuser function can be viewed in the Multiuser Explorer in the Status tab. This is the first place that you should look if there is any unexpected behavior when using the multiuser function. (See Information tab [} 25]) Also, check whether the Twin CAT 3 Ads Git Server Windows service has been started on the target system and restart it if necessary. How can I restart a project that has already been created? Local Git repositories can be deleted in the Status tab in the Multiuser Explorer using the Delete Multiuser files/ Deactive Multiuser button, which allows you to restart a project that has already been created. (See Information tab [} 25]) I'm getting a "Repository Exists Exception" message. How can I resolve this? A Git repository has already been created for the current project due to an invalid operation in the past. Delete this invalid repository in the Status tab in the Multiuser Explorer using the Delete Multiuser files/ Deactive Multiuser button. The History View seems to be messed up, why is this? Entries are added to the History View in descending order according to their timestamp (with the newest entry at the top). Check whether the times set on the target system and the engineering system are identical. "Force Update" does not update the multiuser repository on the target system, why is that? The multiuser function is built on top of the Git source control system. Git always needs to be in a conflict- free state before pushing changes. To this end, the "Force Update" function was created, which allows the current local state to be activated on the target system without having to take the Git state into account. This function should only be used if the current state of the local system needs to be run during commissioning without taking the changes made by the other programmers into account. Once the project has been activated, the synchronization of the underlying Git must be performed later on. Start the synchronization either by logging in, reactivating the configuration, or via a manual push. (See Manual tab [} 25]) I'm getting an "ADS error 0x745: Timeout has expired" message. How can I resolve this? In Multiuser Explorer, open the Status tab. The message "Remote Not Exists" indicates that the remote repository has not been created or has been deleted. Alternatively, look at the target system, which can also be accessed in the Windows Explorer under C: \Program Data\Beckhoff\Multiuser Repository. If you get this message several times, restart the Twin CAT 3 Ads Git Server Windows service on the target system. I'm getting an "ADS error 0x1: An internal error has occurred" message. How can I resolve this? Check whether the multiuser function has been properly installed. The Lib Git2Sharp.dll, Tc Ads Git Package.dll, and Tc Ads Git Server.exe files, along with the cmd and mingw32 folders and other elements, must be present in the C:\Twin CAT\Functions\Multiuser folder. 30 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

3rd Party Licenses 9 3rd Party Licenses The Twin CAT Multiuser functionality uses Git as source control system, which is released under GNU General Public License version 2.0. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 31

3rd Party Licenses distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 32 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

## Page 33

3rd Party Licenses and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 33

3rd Party Licenses collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 34 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

3rd Party Licenses compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 35

3rd Party Licenses any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free 36 Version: 1.7.1 TE1000

3rd Party Licenses Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by TE1000 Version: 1.7.1 37
