Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

Function Blocks 3 Function Blocks 3.1 FB_C69xx Set Led Color This function block is deprecated on newer IPCs. Use FB_Set Led Color_BAPI from Tc2_System instead. The function block FB_C69xx Set Led Color can be used to switch the user LED on the C69xx PC. The LED color is switched via a rising edge at b Execute and the e New Color parameter. The LED can be switched off (e New Color = e ULED_Off) or set to red (e New Color = e ULED_Red), blue (e New Color = e ULED_Blue) or green (e New Color = e ULED_Green). TYPE E_User LED_Color : ( e ULED_Off := 0, e ULED_Red := 1, e ULED_Blue := 2, e ULED_Green := 3 ); END_TYPE Inputs VAR_INPUT b Execute : BOOL; e New Color : E_User LED_Color; END_VAR Name Type Description b Execute BOOL Switching of the LED with rising edge. e New Color E_User LED_Color Color value to be set Outputs VAR_OUTPUT e Last Set Color : E_User LED_Color; b Error : BOOL; END_VAR Name Type Description e Last Set Color E_User LED_Color Last color value set with this function block b Error BOOL Error while setting the LED color Requirements Development environment Target plattform PLC Libraries to include Twin CAT v3.0.0 PC (i386) Tc2_System C69xx 3.2 FB_C69xx Set Watchdog This function block is deprecated on newer IPCs. Use FB_Pc Watchdog_BAPI from Tc2_System instead. TE1000 Version: 1.1.0 9

Function Blocks The function block FB_C69xx Set Watchdog enables a hardware watchdog on the C69xx PC. The watchdog is enabled via b Enable = TRUE and the t Time Out time. The t Time Out time can be a minimum of 2 seconds and a maximum of 255 seconds. Once the watchdog has been enabled, the function block instance must be called cyclically at shorter intervals than t Time Out, since the C69xx PC restarts automatically when t Time Out has elapsed. The watchdog can therefore be used to automatically reboot systems, which have entered an infinite loop or where the PLC has become stuck. The watchdog can be disabled via b Enable = FALSE or t Time Out = T#0s. NOTICE Reboot The watchdog must be disabled before breakpoints are used, before a PLC reset or an overall reset, before a Twin CAT stop, before switching to Config mode or before the configuration is activated, because otherwise the C69xx would reboot immediately once t Time Out has elapsed. Inputs VAR_INPUT t Time Out : TIME; b Enable : BOOL; END_VAR Name Type Description t Time Out TIME Watchdog time, after which a restart is performed. b Enable BOOL Enabling/disabling the watchdog. Outputs VAR_OUTPUT b Enabled : BOOL; b Error : BOOL; END_VAR Name Type Description b Enabled BOOL TRUE = Watchdog is enabled, FALSE = Watchdog is disabled. b Error BOOL Error when enabling or disabling the watchdog.
