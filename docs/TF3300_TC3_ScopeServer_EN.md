Overview 2 Overview Twin CAT 3 Scope is the charting and analysis tool for Twin CAT. Variables in Twin CAT can be recorded and displayed graphically. Sampling rates can be adjusted individually for each channel. Recordings in the µs range and long-term recordings over several days are equally possible. Due to division into a Scope View with multi-core support for the display of the signals and a Scope Server for the recording of the values, it is possible it to connect to servers distributed in the field from a central View. A tool is thus available not only for machine commissioning, but also for process monitoring. The Twin CAT 3 Scope functionality includes cursor tools and trigger functions. Twin CAT 3 Scope also sets new standards for Engineering. Like Twin CAT 3 itself, it is integrated in Microsoft Visual Studio. It is thus possible to use Twin CAT 3 projects and Scope projects in parallel in a single solution. Variables can be shifted very simply from the Twin CAT 3 project to a Scope configuration. Of course the Scope can also still be used as a standalone tool in the framework of the Twin CAT XAE Shell. Due to the constantly increasing range of functions required of data analysis tools, the Twin CAT 3 Scope is subdivided into product levels with different ranges of features. The Twin CAT 3 Scope Base contains a license-free View and a license-free Server. Both are installed together with Twin CAT 3 XAE. Product note The Twin CAT 3 Scope software consists of two products: • Twin CAT 3 Scope View is a Twin CAT 3 engineering product and supplies the graphic interface for the configuration of recordings and the display of signal curves. The View is available in different product levels and is licensed for the device on which it is displayed. This document contains the technical product description. • Twin CAT 3 Scope Server is a Twin CAT 3 function and provides the software for data logging. The server sends the recorded data to the View. The software is installed on distributed devices or on the local target device. The server license is issued for the device on which the server runs. In most cases the Base version, which is installed together with Twin CAT XAE or the Scope View, is sufficient. The server license is only required if it is used independently, i.e. without View, e.g. for control via a PLC function block. The Twin CAT 3 Scope server is documented separately as part of the Twin CAT 3 functions. Both components must be available in the system in order to be able to use the Scope. Principle of operation The principle of operation of the two main components View and Server is explained in detail in the Basic Concept in the Technical Introduction. Product level / feature list The following table shows which functionalities are available with which Twin CAT Scope level and the corresponding licensing arrangement. 8 Version: 1.3.1 TF3300

Configuration 4 Configuration 4.1 Scope Server configuration The Twin CAT 3 Scope Server is responsible for the recording of process variables, which it communicates to the Twin CAT 3 Scope View via ADS. The Scope View informs the Scope Server what it has to record in the form of a configuration. The Server can run on a device with the View, but it may also run autonomously on another system without View. In this case the View communicates with the server from an external device (e.g. service notebook). As a Windows service the Twin CAT 3 Scope Server is dependent on the Twin CAT 3 System Service. A GUI is available for the configuration of the Server. This is described below. The GUI can be found under Windows Start Menu / Beckhoff / TF3300 Scope Server. Twin CAT 3 Scope Server Tracing: A Scope Server log can be switched on under Tracing. This can supply insightful information in cases of support. However, you are advised against activating logging by default. 20 Version: 1.3.1 TF3300

## Page 21

Configuration Twin CAT 3 Scope Server Workfolder: The workfolder for the swap file of the Scope Server for long-term recordings can be specified here. Swapping takes place by activating the File Store Option in the Scope Properties of the View. In cases of service an external medium (e.g. USB stick) can also be selected as the swap location with devices having a limited memory. Twin CAT 3 Scope Server Connect: Click the Connections … button in the Connect tab to view the remote systems and the corresponding recordings that are currently active on the Scope server. TF3300 Version: 1.3.1 21

## Page 22

Configuration The Scope server can be restarted with the Reset Server button, if required. Twin CAT 3 Scope Server Info: The current version data for the Scope Server and the installed Twin CAT version are available on the Info tab. Beyond that the product level information can also be found here. It can adopt the values BASE, TC3_SERVER_TRIAL or TC3_SERVER. The product levels of the Scope Server are independent of the product levels of the Twin CAT 3 Scope View. 4.2 Exporting data With the Twin CAT 3 Scope Export Tool, the Scope Server offers a possibility to export data into other file formats. This does not require an installed Scope View or Visual Studio®. The tool is described below. 22 Version: 1.3.1 TF3300

## Page 23

Configuration 4.2.1 Automated export Along with the Scope, the Twin CAT 3 Scope Export Tool is additionally installed in the TE130X Scope View and in the TF3300 Scope Server directory. This can be used to subsequently convert contents of svdx files into the supported export formats – without Visual Studio. The tool comes complete with its documentation. For the tdms and dat formats, a full View or server license is required. The Twin CAT 3 Scope Export Tool can also be used for export via a command line call, based on specified parameters. The interface shown here can be suppressed by entering the keyword "silent" in the command line. In this case the export is executed in the background. To automate the export, the tool can be called from the PLC via NT_Start Process. Code sample with fixed strings and fb Start Export as an instance of NT_Start Process: fb Start Export( NETID:= '', PATHSTR:= 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Beckhoff\Twin CAT\Functions\TF3300-Scope- Server\TC3Scope Export Tool.exe', DIRNAME:= 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Beckhoff\Twin CAT\Functions\TE130x-Scope-View', COMNDLINE:= '"svd=c:\Scope Project.svd" target=c:\Test Export.csv silent', START:= b Start, TMOUT:= T#20S, BUSY=> , ERR=> , ERRID=> ); Export Io T File Arrays as Oversampling Symbols to CSV To export an array symbol from an Io T file as an oversampling signal to a CSV file, only the array signal is selected in the signal selection. TF3300 Version: 1.3.1 23

## Page 24

Configuration When exporting, the oversampling signals are now saved in addition to the other signals and time stamps. Here, all signals which have the same oversampling rate and thus a new identical sampling rate are grouped and stored with the same time series. Export Io T File Arrays as Oversampling Symbols to CSV To export an array symbol from an Io T file as an oversampling signal to a CSV file, only the array signal is selected in the signal selection. Separate tables are created for the different sampling rates of the selected signals. All signals with the same array length are thus grouped in a table. This means that all signals in a table have a value at any time. If several signals with different sampling rates are selected during the export, the table name, which can be set in the configuration ("Config"), serves as the base name for the new tables. The sampling rate is appended after the base name (e.g. Export Table_200_ms). 24 Version: 1.3.1 TF3300

Appendix 5 Appendix 5.1 FAQ – frequently asked questions and answers Frequently asked questions are answered in this section in order to make it easier for you to work with Twin CAT 3 Scope. If you have any further questions, please contact our support (-157). 1. Is it true that "Twin CAT 3 Scope" in the Twin CAT 3 world is not a product, but a generic term for various products? [} 25] 2. Why are there different product levels for the Twin CAT 3 Scope? [} 25] 3. Can the Scope View Professional be operated with the Scope Server Base? What are the restrictions? [} 25] 4. Why should the TF3300 Scope Server be used, when the "Use local Server" option can also be enabled? [} 25] 5. Can the Twin CAT Scope View be integrated into an own visualization? [} 25] 6. Are open source software components used in Twin CAT Measurement? [} 25] Is it true that "Twin CAT 3 Scope" in the Twin CAT 3 world is not a product, but a generic term for various products? Yes, "Twin CAT 3 Scope" is a generic term. The Twin CAT 3 Scope is subdivided into the Scope View and Scope Server products. This means that a Twin CAT 3 Scope always consists of the View and Server products. Beyond that there are also different product levels. Why are there different product levels for the Twin CAT 3 Scope? The Scope is a constantly growing tool for data logging and analysis; however, not every Scope user requires the full range of functions for his purposes. Therefore, we offer product levels tailored as far as possible to the application. The currently available product levels are Base and Professional. Base is free of license costs and can be used for machine commissioning. Professional is very well suited for process monitoring in addition to machine commissioning. Can the Scope View Professional be operated with the Scope Server Base? What are the restrictions? Yes, the Professional View can also be operated with the Base Server. Only the restrictions of the Base Server version need to be observed. It is also possible, for example, to scope a remote device with the local Base Server. To do this the "Use local server" option must be set in the channel settings. Why should the TF3300 Scope Server be used, when the "Use local Server" option can also be enabled? As soon as a Scope Server is to run autonomously on a remote device, the Twin CAT function TF3300 Scope Server is required. The server can thus be controlled from the PLC or operated in Headless mode, for example, without a view being connected. Can the Twin CAT Scope View be integrated into an own visualization? Yes, you can integrate the Scope Control into your own . NET based visualization application. The license model remains identical. Details and examples can be found here. Are open source software components used in Twin CAT Measurement products? TF3300 Version: 1.3.1 25
