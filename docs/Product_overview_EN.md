Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

Philosophy 2 Philosophy In order to master the complexity of modern machines and at the same time to reduce the necessary engineering expenditure, the trend moves to modular control software. Individual functions, assemblies or machine units are thereby regarded as modules. These modules should be as independent as possible and structured hierarchically. The structural format should be that the lowest modules are the easiest and reusable basic elements. With standardized interfaces the software modules from higher-ranked modules can be combined to more complex machine units, up to a complete machine. Ideally the individual modules can be put into operation, extended, scaled and reused independent from each other. The innovative software architecture of Twin CAT 3 exactly allows this kind of programming. Due to this possibilities for the software application Twin CAT 3 is also called e Xtended Automation (XA). e Xtended Automation is the combination of the latest IT-technologies and scientific software-tools with the automation technology. This philosophy has been implemented not only in the section of engineering, but also up into the runtime. Twin CAT 3 is classified into e Xtended Automation Engineering (XAE) and in e Xtended Automation Runtime (XAR). e Xtended Automation Engineering XAE: One of the main approaches of Twin CAT 3 is to simplify the software engineering. Instead of developing own standalone-tools it is obviously worthwhile to integrate into common and existing software development environments. For Twin CAT 3 this development environment is the Microsoft Visual Studio®. By integrating Twin CAT 3 as an extension into the Visual Studio®, we are providing the user an expandable and future- proof platform. New definitions just as Solution or Solution Explorer find their way into the automation world. Even by inserting a Twin CAT Project into the Solution you will rapidly notice the known Twin CAT System Manager tree, whereby also Twin CAT 2 users can switch to Twin CAT 3 very easy. One of the main advantages is the integration of the Twin CAT 2 PLC Control into the Twin CAT System Manager. So the developer only needs one development tool for his application. This saves not only the switch between different development environments, but it also simplifies trainings, because now there is only one tool to be trained. There are different possibilities how the integration into the Microsoft Visual Studio® can be done: 1. If the classic PLC programmer has not installed Microsoft Visual Studio® by now, the Twin CAT 3 Setup automatically will install the necessary Visual Studio® Shell. The Twin CAT 3 extensions are available after the installation. The known functionalities of Twin CAT 2 are covered and extended. The object-oriented extensions of the third edition are available for the PLC programming languages of the IEC 61131-3. Therewith it is also possible to inheritance PLC function blocks. In addition to PLC modules also modules for NC, CNC or Safety-applications can be created. 2. If there already is a version of Microsoft Visual Studio® on the Engineering-PC, but which is no full version, the Twin CAT 3 Extensions will be installed and integrate themselves into the existing Microsoft environment. The functional range is the same than under section 1. 3. If there is a full version of the Microsoft Visual Studios® on the Engineering PC, the Twin CAT 3 Extensions will be integrated into the existing Visual Studio®. Among the mentioned classic PLC functions, there are possibilities wherewith applications in C, C++ or MATLAB®/Simulink® can be programmed. 4. If there is Twin CAT 3 without a full version of Microsoft Visual Studios® on the Engineering PC, the classic PLC functionalities are available. If you later on install a full version of the Microsoft Visual Studio, the whole functional range including C, C++ and also MATLAB®/Simulink® is available. 8 Version: 1.14.1 Twin CAT 3

Philosophy More details about the respective system requirements, the installation and the licensing can be found in the Twin CAT 3 product description. e Xtended Automation Runtime XAR: The Twin CAT 3 Runtime offers a realtime environment where Twin CAT modules can be loaded, executed or administrated. The individual modules must not be created with the same Compiler and therewith can be programmed independent and by different manufacturers or developers. Furthermore it is not important if the modules are PLC, NC, CNC or from C-Code generated modules. The generated modules are called cyclic from the Tasks. Several Tasks can run on one control PC. Because the different modules(SPS, C/C++, MATLAB®) can call themselves in the Twin CAT 3 Runtime, there are much more possibilities for the software architecture of the application. So it is possible to combine several modules, which have there own functionalities, to one complete machine application. The amount of modules, which are called from the task are unlimited. If the code-execution will take too long, the user will get cyclic exceedings. With Twin CAT 3 the amount of tasks is theoretically limited on 65000. But in the end it depends on the system resources of the runtime device. A further highlight of Twin CAT 3 is the support of Multicore CPU's. Individual Twin CAT Tasks can be allocated on different cores of a CPU. So the performance of the newest multicore Industrial- and Embedded PCs can be used at its best. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.14.1 9

Overview 3 Overview This chapter explains the Twin CAT 3 naming concept and the classification of Twin CAT 3 products into different categories: • Naming concept [} 11]: explains how to interpret the new Twin CAT 3 product names • Product classes for Twin CAT 3 Functions [} 12]: information about the different categories for Twin CAT 3 Functions • Platforms [} 12]: Twin CAT 3 products are purchased and licensed according to the underlying hardware, this chapter explains the different hardware categories 3.1 Naming concept Twin CAT 3 products are divided into three different groups: • TE xxxx-xxxx: Twin CAT 3 XAE (Engineering) • TC xxxx-xxxx: Twin CAT 3 XAR (Runtime) • TF xxxx-xxxx: Twin CAT 3 Functions (for Twin CAT 2 "Supplement" products) The abbreviations represent the basic Twin CAT 3 naming concept and are thus also important as a reference if you later want to activate or order a Twin CAT 3 license. The general scheme of the Twin CAT 3 naming concept is as follows: The abbreviations "TX abbb" are a description and identification of the actual product, whereas the abbreviations "00pp" describe the product according to your order. The following table explains the abbreviations in more detail: Abbreviation Description T Twin CAT X Describes the Twin CAT 3 Basis System, to which the product belongs. Possible entries are: E=Engineering, C=Runtime, F=Function a Describes the product class. If the product belongs to the "Runtime" or "Engineering" base system, it is always "1". If the product is a Twin CAT 3 Function, you can find more information here [} 12]. bbb Number which uniquely identifies a product in the corresponding product class. v Describes the device ordered by a customer. There is already a license on this device, which was installed and activated during production. 00 Reserved for later use, at the moment filled out with "00". Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.14.1 11

Overview pp Describes the hardware platform, on the basis of which the product was licensed. More information about the different hardware platforms can be found here [} 12]. bbbb Optional: the Build number describes the version number of a product in detail. For better understanding, the following table shows some examples: Product Identifier Description TC1000-0010 Twin CAT 3 ADS, belonging to the basic system "Runtime" with product class "1". Has been licensed by the customer for hardware category 10. TC1000-0020 Twin CAT 3 ADS, belonging to the basic system "Runtime" with product class "1". Has been licensed by the customer for hardware category 20. TE1000-0030 Twin CAT 3 Engineering, belonging to the basic system "Engineering" with product class "1". Has been licensed by the customer for hardware category 30. TF6100-0070 Twin CAT 3 OPC UA, belonging to the basic system "Function" with product class "6". Has been licensed by the customer for hardware category 70. TF6310-0020 Twin CAT 3 TCP/IP, belonging to the basic system "Function" with product class "6". Has been licensed by the customer for hardware category 20. ... ... 3.2 Product classes for TC3 Functions Twin CAT 3 Functions have been grouped into several categories, which represent a so-called "Product Class" in the TC3 naming convention. The available categories are: 3.3 Hardware categories Every Twin CAT 3 product is bought and licensed according to the underlying hardware. The hardware depends on the operating system and CPU and is identified by a category ID. The following images shows all hardware categories and their corresponding Beckhoff hardware products: 12 Version: 1.14.1 Twin CAT 3

System requirements 4 System requirements Twin CAT 3 Engineering (XAE) and Twin CAT 3 Runtime (XAR) have different system requirements. If you install XAE and XAR on one computer, the requirements for both components must be met. Some components (such as Tc Xae Shell64 or Twin CAT Functions) have their own system requirements, which must be considered in combination and can be found in the respective documentation. Twin CAT 3 e Xtended Automation Engineering (XAE) Twin CAT 3 XAE is an extension for Visual Studio, so that the requirements of Visual Studio must essentially be met. System requirements for the Visual Studio 2017 Shell ("Tc Xae Shell") or Visual Studio 2022 Shell ("Tc Xae Shell64") supplied: Operating systems • Windows 10 (Tc Xae Shell64: min. Windows 10 20H2) • Windows 11 Hardware • Processor speed 1.8 GHz or faster; dual-core or better is recommended • Main memory: at least 4 GB RAM (with Tc Xae Shell64: 16GB RAM recommended) • Hard disk space: 10 GB of available memory if Visual Studio is not yet installed. • Hard disk speed: the use of a solid-state drive (SSD) is recommended. • Graphics card: the minimum supported resolution should be 720p (1208 x 720). Recommended: support for Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080) or higher. Twin CAT 3 e Xtended Automation Runtime (XAR) System requirements for Twin CAT 3 XAR depending on the program to be executed: Operating systems • Windows Embedded Standard 7 (WES7): supported up to Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 • Windows 10 • Windows 10 LTSB, LTSC • Windows 11: supported from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026.16 Beckhoff • Windows Embedded Compact 7 (WEC7): supported up to Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 Embedded PC with • Twin CAT/BSD Twin CAT 3 image Hardware • Hard disk space: at least 2 GB • Main memory depends on the activated configuration Hyper-V environment: • The runtime environment cannot be started within a Hyper-V environment. This refers in particular to Hyper-V virtual machines running in a privileged Hyper-V machine. As soon as a component of the computer uses Hyper-V, only the engineering environment (XAE) can be used on this computer, but not the runtime environment (XAR). In addition to software solutions for virtual machines, Hyper-V can also be used by operating system tools (Device Guard, Credential Guard, Virtualization-based Security,...) or other Hyper-V programs. • Twin CAT tries to detect these Hyper-V environments; however, due to the nature of virtualization approaches, they try and avoid detection, so that Twin CAT is unable to guarantee 100% detection. • With Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026, users can also use the user mode runtime. VT-x CPU function: • For 64-bit operating systems, the VT-x CPU function is mandatory (must be activated and available in the BIOS). Real-time behavior: Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.14.1 13

## Page 14

System requirements • For optimal, reliable and high-performance real-time behavior, a complete system (hardware, BIOS, operating system, driver software, real-time control software) is absolutely essential. Each individual component of the control system must be checked and optimized for this application in order to achieve optimal, reliable and high-performance real-time behavior. Beckhoff Industrial PCs are optimized in detail for this purpose. When using the Twin CAT 3 Runtime (XAR) on PCs from third-party providers, flawless real-time behavior cannot be guaranteed. Component-specific system requirements: • Further system requirements can be found in the respective product descriptions of the Twin CAT components. 4.1 Compatibility of anti-virus programs (with the real-time execution of Twin CAT) Beckhoff recommends that you give careful consideration to the use of anti-virus programs. Anti-virus programs can be useful in helping the user to discover and remove malware that has infected the computer through the careless opening of mail attachments or via compromised downloads from the internet and is being run. However, such threat scenarios are unlikely with many purposes of use of controllers. If malware does infect a controller via a security hole, e.g. in the operating system, an anti-virus program no longer offers reliable protection. The malware can recognize the popular anti-virus programs and it potentially runs with the same rights as the anti-virus program, which it can then simply deactivate. Anti-virus programs and operating systems must be updated regularly in order to be effective. These updates may be subject to validations for the release of the controller and the software components installed in it for productive use, making it impossible for Beckhoff to make a reliable statement about the compatibility with the Twin CAT automation software. NOTICE Incompatibility with Kaspersky Anti-Virus SDK The anti-virus software Kaspersky Anti-Virus is incompatible with the Twin CAT Runtime XAR. Products developed on the basis of the Kaspersky Anti-Virus SDK are also incompatible with the Twin CAT Runtime XAR. If you use Kaspersky Anti-Virus or products based on the Kaspersky Anti-Virus SDK, you can continue to use the Twin CAT Engineering XAE as normal, but the local RUN mode may react by crashing or freezing. Windows Defender and other anti-virus programs Windows Defender is an anti-virus component that comes with Windows 10 and is regarded as being as good as third-party products. During regular tests of Windows Security Updates and Windows Defender within the scope of system and real-time examinations of Twin CAT and Beckhoff IPCs, Beckhoff has so far found no real-time violations of Twin CAT over a long period of time. This empirical value is taken as an indication of a compatible coexistence of Windows Defender and Twin CAT; however, no assurance for future updates can be derived from this. This experience has been gained in tests with active Windows Defender with the function extension "Real-time Protection" disabled at the same time. Due to its mode of operation, this function extension is a probable source of real-time violations of Twin CAT, because it monitors and examines process sequences and their data by accessing the Windows system. Third-party anti-virus programs interact in different ways with the Windows system following installation and activation. Due to the complexity and the expenditure involved in examining this third-party software, Beckhoff does not regard itself as being able to make qualified statements about the influence of such software on the real-time execution of Twin CAT. Beckhoff recommendation on the use of Windows Defender and other anti-virus programs Beckhoff recommends preventing the exposure of controllers to direct points of entry of malware into the system as far as possible by selecting a holistic approach and not relying on the use of anti-virus software alone. 14 Version: 1.14.1 Twin CAT 3

System requirements For use in Beckhoff products, Beckhoff offers its customers regular image updates for Beckhoff Industrial PCs containing validated security updates for use with Twin CAT. Disclaimer Beckhoff makes no warranties, expressed or implied, for real-time performance of it’s automation software Twin CAT for execution and real-time condition compliance in all cycles after installation or update of other software, including but not limited to anti-virus software, OS kernel mode drivers, security patches, and other software. Twin CAT offers tools to validate real-time execution, and generally, the use of any software after installation on a control computer requires thorough review of system integrity as customary and state of the art in automation technology use cases. 4.1.1 Configuring and activating Windows Defender Since Beckhoff cannot give any predictive assurances regarding the behavior of Windows Defender following future updates and since many controllers are unable to regularly procure the updates required for effective use, the component is deactivated by a group rule in the standard images from Beckhoff. Activation of Windows Defender in Beckhoff standard systems with Windows 10 1. Open Windows Run with the shortcut [Windows + R] and enter "gpedit.msc". Confirm the dialog with OK. ð The group policy editor opens. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.14.1 15

System requirements 2. Adapt the entry "Turn off Windows Defender" accordingly. 3. Start Windows Defender in the Control Panels. 16 Version: 1.14.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 17

System requirements 4. Activate Windows Defender with the Start now button. ð Windows Defender is activated. 4.1.2 Update Windows Defender and perform a scan By default the Windows Update service is deactivated on Beckhoff standard systems with Windows 10. This is the only way to ensure that updates are not automatically installed and can thus negatively affect the controller. So that the Windows Defender definition files can be updated as shown here, the Windows Update service must be temporarily activated. As the update process itself runs differently depending on the update, it may be useful to set Twin CAT to CONFIG mode. 1. Open Windows Run with the shortcut [Windows + R] and enter "services.msc". Confirm the dialog with OK. ð The Services dialog opens. Twin CAT 3 Version: 1.14.1 17

System requirements ð The computer is scanned. Windows Defender with automated updates If you decide, contrary to the recommendation given at the beginning, to use Windows Defender with automatic updates, familiarize yourself with the configuration in the MSDN. This includes in particular the following properties: • Time / frequency of the procurement of updates • Time / frequency of the system scan • The version of the definition files that was acquired. ð The last point in particular is relevant for the avoidance of negative effects on the operation of controllers. Because several new versions are sometimes published on the same day, there is no checking of where which version is in use in the case of direct acquisition. For controllers it is advantageous to check a certain version of the definition files first and then to install them in production. Microsoft describes different ways to do this: https://docs.microsoft.com/.... They allow the definition files to be downloaded first, tried out on a system and then distributed efficiently. 4.1.3 Determining monitoring exceptions You can additionally stipulate whether file accesses made from the Twin CAT machine controller are excluded from monitoring by anti-virus programs in order to reduce corresponding false alarms of the anti- virus software: 22 Version: 1.14.1 Twin CAT 3

## Page 26

System requirements 4.2 Supported network controllers The Twin CAT RT driver is required for a network port if real-time protocols such as Ether CAT are used. It enables the Twin CAT real-time to access the network chip. The driver can be installed using the "Tc Rte Install.exe" tool, which is provided in C:\Twin CAT\3.1\System. On the following page you will find a list of the supported Intel chips. The driver recognizes the chips by the vendor and device ID. Supporting a network card does not mean that the system is real-time capable. Beckhoff ensures this for its own IPCs and EPCs through a variety of measures. However, this cannot be guaranteed for other devices that use the same network controller. NOTICE Observe Beckhoff compatibility The NICs installed in Beckhoff controllers are specially selected and qualified for RT use; no properties can be assured on third-party devices. If in doubt, the original Intel driver must be used, which does not allow operation with the Twin CAT runtime with real-time protocols.
