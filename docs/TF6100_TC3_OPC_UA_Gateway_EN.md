Overview 2 Overview OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is the next generation of the familiar OPC standard. This is a globally standardized communication protocol via which machine data can be exchanged irrespective of the manufacturer and platform. OPC UA already integrates common security standards directly in the protocol. Another major advantage of OPC UA over the conventional OPC standard is its independence from the COM/DCOM system. Detailed information on OPC UA can be found on the web pages of the OPC Foundation. The Twin CAT 3 Function TF6100 OPC UA consists of several software components that enable data exchange with Twin CAT based on OPC UA. The following table provides an overview of the individual product components. Software component Description Twin CAT OPC UA Server Provides an OPC UA Server interface so that UA clients can access the Twin CAT runtime. Twin CAT OPC UA Client Provides OPC UA Client functionality to enable communication with other OPC UA Servers based on PLCopen-standardized function blocks and an easy- to-configure I/O device. Twin CAT OPC UA Configurator Graphical user interface for configuring the Twin CAT OPC UA Server.

Please note that the complexity of these variants can be extended almost at will. The examples given only represent frequently occurring installation variants. Gateway and server on the same device In this scenario, the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway and the Twin CAT OPC UA Server are installed on the same device. The gateway is configured with the default settings in order to establish a connection with the local Twin CAT OPC UA Server with the following Server URL: opc.tcp://localhost:4840. From the client's point of view, two scenarios are supported in this case: • An OPC UA client accesses the lower-level server via the gateway in order to access symbols from the Twin CAT Runtime. The client can be located on the same device or on a device in the network. The communication connection between the client and gateway is OPC UA. • An OPC COM DA client accesses the lower-level server via the gateway in order to access symbols from the Twin CAT Runtime. The client must be located on the same device. The communication connection between client and gateway is OPC COM DA. 12 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100
## Page 13

Installation Gateway and server on different devices In this scenario, the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway and the Twin CAT OPC UA Server are installed on different devices. The gateway is configured to establish a connection with the remote Twin CAT OPC UA Server by storing its server URL, e.g. opc.tcp://192.168.1.1:4840, in the gateway. From the client's point of view, two scenarios are supported in this case: • An OPC UA client accesses the lower-level server via the gateway in order to access symbols from the Twin CAT Runtime. The client can be located on the same device or on a device in the network. The communication connection between the client and gateway is OPC UA. • An OPC COM DA client accesses the lower-level server via the gateway in order to access symbols from the Twin CAT Runtime. The client must be located on the same device. The communication connection between client and gateway is OPC COM DA. TF6100 Version: 1.1.1 13
## Page 14

Installation Connecting the gateway to several servers You can also connect the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway to several lower-level Twin CAT OPC UA Servers. The servers can be installed on the same device or on devices in the network. This scenario can of course be extended as required. The following diagram illustrates a scenario in which three Twin CAT OPC UA Servers were connected to the gateway in the network. From the client's point of view, two scenarios are supported in this case: • An OPC UA client accesses the lower-level servers via the gateway in order to access symbols from the individual Twin CAT Runtimes. The client can be located on the same device or on a device in the network. The communication connection between the client and gateway is OPC UA. • An OPC COM DA client accesses the lower-level servers via the gateway in order to access symbols from the Twin CAT Runtimes. The client must be located on the same device. The communication connection between client and gateway is OPC COM DA. 14 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100

Technical introduction 4 Technical introduction 4.1 Quick start The Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway is available for download as a separate setup. The setup automatically configures access to a Twin CAT OPC UA Server running on the same computer as the gateway. If more than one OPC UA server is added to the gateway, or if the server is running on a different computer, the standard configuration has to be modified. Use the Configurator to configure these settings. Configuration of the Twin CAT OPC UA Server Check the configuration of the OPC UA server and make sure that it is operating as expected before continuing. For further information regarding the configuration of the OPC UA Server, read the Quick Start in the chapter "OPC UA Server". Quick start – OPC COM DA To connect an OPC COM DA Client to the gateway, start the client and establish a connection to the following Prog Id: Unified Automation. Ua Gateway.1 When browsing the gateway, one or more OPC UA Servers will be visible in the namespace of the gateway. 16 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100
## Page 17

Technical introduction Quick start – OPC UA The gateway not only offers an OPC COM DA interface, but also allows the aggregation of one or more OPC UA Servers. The gateway also opens an OPC UA interface for this purpose. The gateway can be accessed via the following OPC UA Server URL: opc.tcp://[Hostname Or Ip Address Or Localhost]:48050 The namespace of the gateway then contains all underlying Twin CAT OPC UA Servers. TF6100 Version: 1.1.1 17
## Page 18

Technical introduction 4.2 Recommended steps After the initial commissioning, we recommend that you pay attention to the following points to further configure the gateway and ensure a stable and secure operating environment. Only use secure Identity Tokens The gateway is configured with the activated Identity Token "Anonymous" in the delivery state. We recommend disabling this Identity Token so that only authenticated users can connect to the OPC UA server interface of the gateway. You can disable this setting in the configuration of the endpoints [} 25] of the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway Configurator. Configuration of a user group with access rights You should use the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway Configurator to define a user group that has access rights to the gateway. Users from this user group can then be specified as Identity Token when connecting an OPC UA client to the gateway. 18 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100
## Page 19

Technical introduction Leave insecure endpoints disabled Endpoints classified as insecure are not offered by the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway by default. These can be made available in the gateway via a configuration parameter when configuring the endpoints [} 25] – however, we strongly advise against this and only recommend using the endpoints that are currently considered secure. Furthermore, the unencrypted endpoint ("None/None") is disabled in the gateway's delivery state and we recommend leaving it disabled. If this needs to be activated for compatibility reasons, this can also be done via the configuration parameters in the configurator. Disable 'Accept all certificates' By default, the gateway is configured for easy commissioning so that it automatically trusts all client certificates without having to manually exchange certificates on the gateway side. For security reasons, we recommend disabling this setting. This setting can be disabled via the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway configurator when configuring the endpoints [} 25]. TF6100 Version: 1.1.1 19

## Page 23

Technical introduction These settings are described in more detail below. Autostart In this area you can configure the autostart behavior of the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway. Activate the Ua Gateway Runtime Process option to start the Windows service of the gateway automatically when the computer is switched on. Activate the Notification Area Icon option to start the Windows system tray icon of the gateway when a user logs on. Launching User The Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway is registered as a Windows service by default and is automatically started when the system is started. A specific user context is assigned to the Windows service. The user you select here is assigned to the Windows service. In addition, the user is granted the "Log On As Service" right and is added to the local user group "Ua Gateway Users". User Authentication In this area, you can define which Identity Tokens are available when an OPC UA client is connected to the gateway. You can also define a user group that should have access to the gateway. Users from this user group can then be used by an OPC UA client when establishing a connection. Configuration Permissions It is possible to allow only certain users to change the configuration of the gateway, i.e. to add or remove connections to lower-level servers. You can select from the following settings: Everyone Any user (including users logged in anonymously via OPC UA) who can establish a connection with the gateway can change the configuration. Limit to operating system Only local users and users from the same domain can change the configuration. users Limit to users of this Only users in a specific group are allowed to change the configuration. group TF6100 Version: 1.1.1 23
## Page 24

Technical introduction UA Discovery Registration Activate the Register at Local Discovery Server option if the gateway is to be registered with the local Local Discovery Server (LDS). Remote DCOM Access Depending on the version of the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway used, the configuration option Remote DCOM Access may also be displayed. These configuration parameters are not supported by the gateway and can be ignored. See also System requirements [} 10]. 4.7 Configuration of additional servers Via the Configured UA Servers tab in the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway Configurator [} 20], you can add further lower-level Twin CAT OPC UA Servers to the gateway. On delivery, the gateway already establishes a connection to a Twin CAT OPC UA Server that has been installed on the same system. To configure additional Twin CAT OPC UA Servers or to remove them from the configuration, click on the plus or minus button and then on Apply to save the changes. 24 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100
## Page 25

Technical introduction 4.8 Configuration of the endpoints The UA Endpoints tab in the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway Configurator [} 20] allows you to make settings for the OPC UA endpoint configuration. The OPC UA endpoint is the connection information required by an OPC UA client to connect to the gateway. The configuration options available in this tab are described in more detail below. General In this area, you can enable the configuration switch Allow deprecated security policies to activate deprecated and potentially insecure security policies in the gateway. However, we recommend leaving this option disabled and enabling it only in case of compatibility issues with old OPC UA clients. In this case, however, the correct procedure would be to contact the client vendor for an update. Endpoints Here you can define all necessary settings for the different OPC UA endpoints, create new endpoints or remove them. A predefined endpoint is already available on delivery, which should normally be sufficient for all applications. This endpoint defines the available security policies, as well as settings for the Network Configuration, Port, Reverse Connect Client URLs and any Security Check Overrides. These configuration elements are described in more detail in the following sections. Network Configuration In this area, you can define the network interface for which the endpoint is to be configured. The endpoint that is defined in the delivery state of the gateway is automatically configured for all network interfaces. This means that the gateway can be accessed through any network interface installed and configured in the operating system. The following configuration parameters can be defined here: TF6100 Version: 1.1.1 25
## Page 26

Technical introduction Configuration parameters Description Endpoint URL Endpoint URL of the gateway as it appears in the OPC UA client when Get Endpoint is called. Protocol Protocol to be used. Only the "UA TCP" protocol is supported. Hostname / IP Host name or IP address of the device on which the gateway was installed. Network Adapter Selection of the network adapter under which the gateway should be accessible for OPC UA clients. Port Network port (TCP) under which the gateway should be accessible for OPC UA clients. Security In this area, you can configure the supported security policies of the endpoint. Activate the checkboxes in front of the respective security policy to configure it for the endpoint. Next to the security policy is a selection element for the Message Security Mode that applies to the endpoint. Reverse Connect Client URLs In this area, you can enter the endpoint URLs of clients that are to be used for the Reverse Connect functionality. Security Check Overrides In this area, you can configure exception rules for the validation of various security options. 4.9 Migration of TF6120 One of the primary purposes of the UA Gateway is to provide a sustainable connectivity in order to replace the Tx6120 OPC DA supplement/function. Observe the following notes if you wish to migrate Tx6120 OPC DA to UA Gateway. Standard configuration The standard configuration of the UA Gateway automatically establishes a connection with the local OPC UA Server and offers the OPC DA clients an OPC DA interface. For a connection based on this standard configuration, the OPC DA clients must take the following into account: • The default Prog ID of the UA Gateway is "Unified Automation. Gateway.1". The Twin CAT OPC DA Server uses a different Prog ID ("Beckhoff. Twin CATOpc Server DA"). • The UA Gateway always uses a Prog ID instead of multiple clones. • The Item Identifie of an OPC symbol is generated differently in the UA Gateway than in the Twin CAT OPC DA Server. This behavior can be changed to be more similar to that of the OPC DA server. Changing the syntax of an Item Identifier The syntax used by the UA Gateway for Item Identifier can be changed so that the latter corresponds more to the type of the Twin CAT OPC DA Server. By default, the UA Gateway uses a different syntax to that of the Twin CAT OPC DA Server when creating its identifiers. UA Gateway sample: 26 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100
## Page 27

Technical introduction Sample Twin CAT OPC DA Server: The UA Gateway uses a prefix so that the underlying OPC UA Client from which the variable originates can be clearly identified. The following steps are required to configure the UA Gateway so that it forms its identifiers in approximately the same way as the Twin CAT OPC DA Server. The functionality has been implemented to simplify the migration process. 1. Open the UA Gateway configuration file C:\Program Files (x86)\Unified Automation\Ua Gateway\bin\uagateway.config.xml 2. Look for the following XML tags in the XML file: <Opc Server Config> <Com Da Server Config> <Com Da Namespace Use Alias>false</Com Da Namespace Use Alias> </Com Da Server Config> </Opc Server Config> 3. If the XML tag Com Da Namespace Use Alias is set to "true", user-defined prefixes can be specified. To do this, look for the following XML tag in the same XML file: <Opc Server Config> <Ua Server Config> <Configured Namespaces> ... </Configured Namespaces </Ua Server Config> </Opc Server Config> 4. In this XML structure, identify the Twin CAT OPC UA Server namespace. By default, it should read as follows: <Opc Server Config> <Ua Server Config> <Configured Namespaces> ... <Namespace> <Index>...</Index> <Uri>Tc Opc Ua Server/urn:Hostname:Beckhoff Automation:Ua:PLC1</Uri> <Allow Rename Uri>false</Allow Rename Uri> <Unique Id>Tc Opc Ua Server#Tc Opc Ua Server/urn:Hostname:Beckhoff Automation:Ua:PLC1</Unique Id> <Com Alias>...</Com Alias> TF6100 Version: 1.1.1 27
## Page 28

Technical introduction </Namespace> ... </Configured Namespaces </Ua Server Config> </Opc Server Config> 5. On your computer, the placeholder "..." may look different. Set <Com Alias> to your preferred prefix, for example "PLC1". The identifiers are then created with the prefix "PLC1". 4.10 Security 4.10.1 Overview One of the reasons for the success of OPC UA as a communication technology is the integrated security mechanisms. Data communication based on OPC UA can be secured on two layers: transport and application layer. When connecting to the server, the client first selects an endpoint, which specifies the security functions to be used. Endpoints A server offers the client a list of different endpoints [} 28] to which the client can connect. An endpoint describes, among other things, which security functions (e.g. Message Security mode, Security Policy and available Identity Tokens) the communication connection via this endpoint should fulfill. For example, an endpoint may require signing and encryption of data packets (transport layer), as well as additional authentication of the client based on user name/password (application layer). Transport layer A communication connection based on OPC UA can be secured at the transport layer. This is done through the use of client/server certificates and a mutual trust relationship between client and server application. Here, the client must trust the server certificate and vice versa in order for a communication connection to be established. This requires a mutual certificate exchange [} 30]. Application layer In addition to the transport layer, a communication connection can also be secured at the application layer. For this purpose, various authentication mechanisms [} 31] are available, which are offered by the server endpoint. 4.10.2 Endpoints The Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway provides various endpoints for OPC UA clients via the standard port 48050/ tcp. The endpoints define the connection type between client and server and whether it should be secured or unsecured. 28 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100

Technical introduction Relationship of trust Please note that in order to use the secure endpoints, a trust relationship must be established between server and client, which is usually done via their certificates. The configuration of such a trust relationship on the gateway side is explained here [} 30]. Deprecated endpoints Please note that the security profiles currently available in the endpoints may be classified as potentially insecure over time and will be replaced by newer ones. In this case, an update of the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway is recommended. A configuration switch can be used to reactivate security policies that are deprecated and classified as insecure. However, we recommend leaving this configuration switch disabled for security reasons. List of endpoints The following list summarizes the endpoints of the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway. This includes endpoints that have already been discontinued. By default, the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway only offers endpoints that are currently considered secure. Security profile Security mode Short description None None No encryption or signing of messages is carried out at this endpoint. Authentication [} 31], on the other hand, is possible. Basic128Rsa15 (deprecated) Sign / Sign & Encrypt This endpoint has been classified as deprecated from a security perspective and is disabled by default. If necessary, the endpoint can be enabled again. Basic256 (deprecated) Sign / Sign & Encrypt This endpoint has been classified as deprecated from a security perspective and is disabled by default. If necessary, the endpoint can be enabled again. Basic256Sha256 Sign / Sign & Encrypt Endpoint currently present in the server for secure signing and encryption. Additional authentication [} 31] is possible. Aes256_Sha256_Rsa Pss Sign / Sign & Encrypt Endpoint currently present in the server for secure signing and encryption. Additional authentication [} 31] is possible. Aes256_Sha256_Rsa Oaep Sign / Sign & Encrypt Endpoint currently present in the server for secure signing and encryption. Additional authentication [} 31] is possible. All endpoints in the list can be enabled or disabled via the gateway configuration. In the following figure, all endpoints are enabled.

Technical introduction 4.10.3 Certificate exchange To secure the communication connection at transport layer via a secure endpoint [} 28], it is necessary to establish a mutual trust between client and server. By default, the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway generates a machine-specific, self-signed key pair consisting of a public and a private key when it is started for the first time. However, you can also use any certificate authority or technology for integration into your IT infrastructure, e.g. Active Directory or Open SSL. For easy administration and secure access to certificates, it makes sense to set up a Global Discovery Server. To establish a trust relationship between any OPC UA client and the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway, you need the public key of the client certificate. The gateway must trust this server accordingly. The gateway manages the trust settings for client certificates in a subdirectory of the application directory. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the client and server certificate when establishing a secure communication connection using the example of Twin CAT OPC UA Client and Twin CAT OPC UA Server. In the case of the latter, however, this can also be transferred 1:1 to the gateway. The client transmits its public key with the Create Session Request. The server then has the option of checking the trust relationship. If the server trusts the client, it transmits its own public key in its response. The client therefore also has the option of checking the trust relationship with the server. If mutual trust is ensured, the communication connection is initiated. The server's public key is then used to encrypt a request from the client to the server. The response from the server to the client is then encrypted with the client's public key. Both communication participants then have the option of decrypting the received message with their private key. Messages are signed in reverse: a message is signed with the sender's private key. Since the recipient recognizes the sender's public key, the signature can be verified. Configure trust relationship via file system By moving client certificates between the trusted/rejected directories, the trust settings can be adjusted accordingly. The public key of a client certificate is automatically stored in the directory for rejected certificates the first time the client attempts to connect to a secure endpoint. By subsequently moving the public key to the directory for trusted certificates, the client is trusted at the next connection attempt and can connect. Accept all certificates If this option is enabled in the configuration of the endpoints [} 25] of the gateway, the gateway automatically trusts all client certificates. In this case, they will not be listed in any of the above directories. 30 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100

Technical introduction Configure the trust relationship using the configurator You can also make the trust settings via Configurator. The configurator includes a graphical user interface for configuring the trust settings. You can trust or reject a certificate via the context menu. 4.10.4 Authentication An OPC UA client can authenticate itself to the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway using various logon methods. The following "Identity Tokens" are supported: • Anonymous • User name/Password • User certificate Delivery state The Identity Token "Anonymous" is enabled when the gateway is delivered. We recommend configuring a user or user group for access to the server after initial commissioning. For more information, see Recommended steps [} 18]. Anonymous This type of authentication allows any OPC UA client to establish a connection to the gateway. It is not necessary to specify a user identity. We recommend disabling this authentication method after commissioning the gateway. This can be done via the configurator. User name/Password This authentication method uses a user name/password combination to authenticate the client on the OPC UA server of the gateway. The user or user group is created and managed in the operating system. User certificate This type of authentication uses a certificate to authenticate to the OPC UA server of the gateway. The handling of user certificates on the gateway side is identical to the use of certificates at transport layer, i.e. the gateway must trust the (user) certificate before the client can successfully authenticate itself to the gateway with the certificate. A separate application directory [} 21] ("pkiuser") for managing the user certificates is available in the gateway for this purpose. Configuration The individual authentication methods are usually enabled/disabled via the configurator. TF6100 Version: 1.1.1 31

Technical introduction 4.11 Logging You can enable a log file in the gateway for extended diagnostics, in which various information is then recorded on the basis of different log levels. Influence of logging on the operating behavior Please note that activating the log file can have a negative impact on the speed and operating behavior of the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway. The default path for the created log files is described in more detail in the chapter Application directories [} 21] and can also be viewed in the Twin CAT OPC UA Gateway configurator. 32 Version: 1.1.1 TF6100

Appendix 6 Appendix 6.1 Error diagnosis Behavior Notes The gateway cannot connect to the server. One of the possible causes is that an old configuration is being used. For example, if there is a new server certificate, the gateway only notices this when the configured endpoint is deleted and reinserted under a different name. With the same endpoint or a new endpoint with the same name, the gateway would use the connection information from a cache and as a result would no longer be able to connect to the server. 6.2 ADS Return Codes Grouping of error codes: Global error codes: 0x0000 [} 34]...
