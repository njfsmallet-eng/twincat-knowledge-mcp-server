Foreword 1.3 Notes on information security The products of Beckhoff Automation Gmb H & Co. KG (Beckhoff), insofar as they can be accessed online, are equipped with security functions that support the secure operation of plants, systems, machines and networks. Despite the security functions, the creation, implementation and constant updating of a holistic security concept for the operation are necessary to protect the respective plant, system, machine and networks against cyber threats. The products sold by Beckhoff are only part of the overall security concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access by third parties to its equipment, systems, machines and networks. The latter should be connected to the corporate network or the Internet only if appropriate protective measures have been set up. In addition, the recommendations from Beckhoff regarding appropriate protective measures should be observed. Further information regarding information security and industrial security can be found in our https://www.beckhoff.com/secguide. Beckhoff products and solutions undergo continuous further development. This also applies to security functions. In light of this continuous further development, Beckhoff expressly recommends that the products are kept up to date at all times and that updates are installed for the products once they have been made available. Using outdated or unsupported product versions can increase the risk of cyber threats.

PLC HMI Web 2 PLC HMI Web PLC HMI Web enables the visualization to be displayed in any web browser. It is realized as a Java script, which queries the display information from the web server. Only changes in the display are transferred cyclically. When a visualization project is downloaded, all files required for the PLC HMI Web up to <TC3.1.4026.0 are transferred to directory C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Boot\Plc\Port_851\Visu and from >=TC3.1.4026.0 to the directory C:\Program Data\Beckhoff\Twin CAT\3.1\Boot Plc\Port_851\Visu. This includes the Java script, the basic HTML page (HTM file) for the visualization, and all images required in the visualization. PLC HMI Web can currently only be configured for PLC projects that can be reached via port 851. The following topics are described below: • Requirements [} 8] • Commissioning of the PLC HMI Web [} 8] • Editor of the Web Visualization object [} 9] Requirements • On the server side the web server must be configured accordingly. • On the client side, as a minimum Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 or the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Safari must be available. Data security violations In order to minimize the risk of data security violations, the following organizational and technical measures are recommended for the system, on which your applications run: • Exposure of the PLC and the control network to open networks and the Internet should be avoided, as far as possible. • Use additional data link layers such as a VPN for remote access and install firewall mechanisms for protection. • Restrict access to authorized persons, change any default passwords during first commissioning and then at regular intervals. Commissioning the PLC HMI Web Step 1: Configure Internet Information Services (IIS) The PLC HMI Web uses the Microsoft IIS as web server. The IIS has to be configured accordingly. The configuration is handled by the TF1810 | TC3 PLC HMI Web installation, which is available for download from the Beckhoff website. Step 2: Enable PLC HMI Web The "Web Visualization" object ( ) enables the PLC HMI Web. You add it to the "Visualization Manager" object in the PLC project tree via the context menu command Add > Web Visualization (see also PLC documentation: Creating a visualization > Visualization object). With the Web Visualization object a visualization task "VISU_TASK" is created in the Solution and a reference to this task in the project. The reference is used to call the visualization code. Therefore, you have to reactivate the configuration after adding the object. Deleting a Web Visualization object If you delete a Web Visualization object and have not added an additional Target Visualization object, you have to delete the task "VISU_TASK" under System > Tasks in the Twin CAT project tree. This task is not required in the integrated visualization. (See also TF1800: Editor of the Target Visualization object and PLC: Integrated visualization) 8 Version: 1.4.1 TF1810

PLC HMI Web Step 3: Call PLC HMI Web In order to call the start page of the visualization, enter the following address in the web browser: https:// device_name/Tc3Plc Hmi Web/Port_851/Visu/webvisu.htm Example: https://localhost/Tc3Plc Hmi Web/Port_851/Visu/webvisu.htm "webvisu" is the HTML start page of the visualization defined in the PLC HMI Web settings. After the call this is used to display the start visualization, which is also defined in the manager, in the browser. The visualization can then be operated in the browser. Optionally you can give the PLC HMI Web a name on calling it in order to be able to address it specifically in the application later on. To do this, enter the parameter Client Name=<Name> after the URL. Example: https://localhost/Tc3Plc Hmi Web/Port_851/Visu/webvisu.htm? Clientname=V_Client XY Editor of the Web Visualization object The "Web Visualization" object ( ), which you can add in the PLC project tree below the "Visualization Manager" object, enables the PLC HMI Web and contains the settings for the web visualization. Double-click on the object in order to edit the settings in an editor window. Start Visualization Name of the visualization to be displayed automatically when the PLC HMI Web is started. "Visualization" is to be entered here as standard. The input assistant can be used to select a different visualization. Name of .htm file Name of the basic HMTL page of the visualization, which must also be entered as the address in the web browser. Example: https://localhost/Tc3Plc Hmi Web/Port_851/Visu/webvisu.htm Updaterate (ms) Update rate in milliseconds, with which the data in the web browser are updated. Default Size of the communication buffer in bytes. Specifies the maximum available memory Communication Buffer for the data transfer between web client and web browser. Show used Button for opening the standard dialog of the Visualization Manager: Here you can Visualizations select the visualizations that are to be used for the PLC HMI Web.

PLC HMI Web Fixed The size of the visualization is retained, irrespective of the size of the browser window. Isotropic The size of the visualization depends on the size of the browser window. The visualization retains its proportions, however. Anisotropic The size of the visualization depends on the size of the browser window. The visualization does not retain its proportions. Client size The display size of PLC HMI Web is defined through the following settings: • Client height: height in pixels • Client width: width in pixels Presentation options Antialiased Drawing Activate this option, if antialiasing is to be used when the visualizations are drawn in the visualization editor window of the programming system. (Offline or online) Default text input This setting is only then active if the input type “Standard” is selected in the input configuration of the visualization element. In this case, the default text entries defined in the Visualization Manager are used. Touchscreen Select this option if the web clients are operated with a touchscreen by default. Keyboard Select this option if the web clients are operated with a keyboard by default. 10 Version: 1.4.1 TF1810
