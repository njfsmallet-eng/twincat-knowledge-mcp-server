Quick start 2 Quick start The following chapter only explains operation from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 onwards. The functions themselves are also available in older Twin CAT versions. The following chapter explains how to create new projects and clone existing ones. The following quick start guide is based on XAE Shell 64 or Visual Studio 2022 and using Git as the source control client. Setting up a project with a project that already exists on the server 1. Select Git as the source control client. See Configuration of the Source Control Client [} 17]. 2. Select the option Git -> Clone Repository.... 8 Version: 1.4.0 TE1000

## Page 9

Quick start 3. If you have reopened this instance of the XAE Shell, you can also go to or open the Git Changes window (View -> Git Changes) and select the Clone Repository... option. ð The following window opens: 4. Enter the path to the Git repository on the server being cloned here, under Repository location. 5. Under Path, select the folder on your local system that the project will be stored and edited in. 6. Select Clone to start cloning. ð After cloning the project, it is automatically opened and the Source Control Management is active. TE1000 Version: 1.4.0 9

## Page 10

Quick start If there are no global Git settings that define the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool as the default compare and merge tool for Twin CAT files on your system yet, set them before you start working on the project. See Selection of the Compare Tool [} 17]. Setting up a project that is not yet under Source Control Management The procedure depends on the Git server that is to be used. For example, while Azur Devops allows you to also push a local repository if a remote does not already exist on the server, most other servers require you to create a remote repository on a Git server first. 1. Create a Git repository on the remote server to be used. ð The repository exists on the server, but is still empty. You now have the following two options: You don't have an existing project and are starting from scratch: 1. Clone the empty repository to the desired working directory (see paragraph Quick start [} 8]) and then paste the desired .gitignore file (see .gitignore [} 25]). 2. If not already done on your system, configure the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool as default compare/ merge tool. See Selection of the Compare Tool [} 17]. ð Afterwards you create a new Twin CAT project in the working directory and start working. You have an existing project that is not yet under Source Control Management and you just want to push it to a Git server. 1. Store the .gitignore file that will be used in the top project directory. See .gitignore [} 25]. 2. Create a local Git repository in your working directory. To do this, use the option Git -> Create Git Repository.... 10 Version: 1.4.0 TE1000

## Page 11

Quick start ð The following window opens: 3. In the Remote URL text box, specify the path to the Git repository on the remote server 4. Press the button Create and Push. If you have not placed a .gitignore file in the top project directory, you will get another entry in the dialog shown above, where you can select a gitignore template that is deposited on Github. Since none of the templates on Github are sufficient for a Twin CAT project, deposit the .gitignore file before this step. Otherwise, all data will be transferred to the remote repository and must be removed manually afterwards.

Integration of the Source Control Management 3 Integration of the Source Control Management Twin CAT 3 uses the Visual Studio Framework as basis of the workbench. One of the advantages of this concept is the simple access to the large selection of programming functions in Visual Studio. Accordingly, Twin CAT also profits from the Source Control Management in Visual Studio. This section describes how you can use this feature in Twin CAT 3. 3.1 Project Files So that a Twin CAT project is compatible with Source Control Management systems and supports work in teams, it is stored in several files. The following file extensions exist in the Twin CAT project: File extension Source Con- Merging permissible Description trol Manage- ment *.tsproj Yes Yes, use Twin CAT Project Twin CAT project file Compare Tool. *.plcproj Yes Yes, use Twin CAT Project Twin CAT PLC project file Compare Tool. *.tmc Yes Not permissible for PLC Twin CAT module class (description file for a projects. Tc Com module) *.tpr Yes Yes File contains the refactoring information for standalone PLC projects *.tpy No - This file serves only for compatibility with programs from other vendors. *.xti Yes Yes, use Twin CAT Project In case of multiple file support, parts of the Compare Tool. Twin CAT project file are stored with this extension. *. Tc TTO Yes Yes, use Twin CAT Project PLC task object Compare Tool. *. Tc POU Yes Yes, use Twin CAT Project PLC program organization unit (POU) Compare Tool. *. Tc DUT Yes Yes, use Twin CAT Project PLC data type Compare Tool *. Tc GVL Yes Yes, use Twin CAT Project PLC global variable list Compare Tool. *. Tc Vis Yes Not currently supported. PLC visualization *. Tc VMO Yes Not currently supported. PLC visualization manager *. Tc GTLO Yes Yes, use Twin CAT Project PLC global texts list Compare Tool. *.sln No - This file is the solution file from Visual Studio (VS). It contains, among other data, a tag indicating the VS version used. If this is checked in, it makes working with different VS versions more difficult. *.suo No This is the user options file for the VS project. It contains information on the selected platform, breakpoints, etc. and is user-specific! It is generated when a project is opened on a computer for the first time. 12 Version: 1.4.0 TE1000

## Page 13

Integration of the Source Control Management TMC file is regenerated automatically The description of the process image of a Tc Com module is stored in the *.tmc file. If this is to be available directly after the checkout (fetching) of a project, even if the project had not previously been compiled on one’s own computer, then the TMC file must be fetched with it (and thus checked in with the project beforehand). The TMC file is automatically re-generated after compiling a PLC project. It is therefore NOT merged for PLC projects and from Twin CAT 3.1 version 4018 also no longer needs to be under Source Control Management! Do not merge files manually In general we do not recommend manual merging of the files of a Twin CAT project. • Always use the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool to merge the files. 3.2 Project settings So that a Twin CAT project that is managed using a source code management system can be processed in a team as independently as possible, various settings can be set. These are described below. Independent Project File It is possible in Twin CAT to save individual sub-projects, NC axes or I/O devices explicitly in separate files. These files then contain all the parameters, etc. of the respective Twin CAT object, so that the complete project file does not have to be "checked out" when making changes to this object. The links of a PLC project, for example, are thus no longer stored in the Twin CAT project file, but in the corresponding XTI file of the PLC project. So that this function can be used in Twin CAT it must be "globally" enabled once. This is done via the Twin CAT –> XAE Environment –> File settings category in the Twin CAT Engineering environment options. The Enable Multiple Files option enables the use of this function for new projects. The options below it define the elements in a new project for which this function is switched on by default. Restart necessary Changes to these options only become effective after restarting the development environment. TE1000 Version: 1.4.0 13

## Page 14

Integration of the Source Control Management Use of Independent Project Files in a project If this option is not activated by default for a Twin CAT object, it can be done manually (or the option can be reset) via the option Independent Project File in the context menu of the Twin CAT object. Objects that are saved as Independent Project Files are marked in the Twin CAT tree with the aid of an overlay icon in the form of a small floppy disk. A black floppy disk indicates that there are no unsaved changes yet for this object, whereas this is the case with a red floppy disk. 14 Version: 1.4.0 TE1000

## Page 15

Integration of the Source Control Management Keep Unrestored Link Info If not set otherwise, Twin CAT only saves the required information so that the project repository is not unnecessarily loaded. In association with this, Twin CAT also checks whether links are still valid. Any invalid links found are automatically deleted. This mechanism is obstructive when merging projects, since only the code and the links can be merged, but the updated process image is only available after recompiling the code that has now been merged. It is thus possible for the link information to be newer than the process image and the automatic optimization function would delete all links to the new variables in the process image. With the option Keep Unrestored Link Info, the link information marked for deletion is retained and automatically restored as soon as the variables show up in the process image. Line IDs Line IDs are needed to map lines in source code to lines in machine code. This is important as soon as breakpoints are set. Without Line IDs, the following scene would not work as desired: A breakpoint is set in the source code. After that, blank lines or comments are inserted in the source code before the breakpoint. These are not changes that lead to an online change. The engineering environment is now closed and reopened. Without stored Line IDs it can happen that the set breakpoints point to blank lines. If Twin CAT remembers the Line IDs, the breakpoints point to the desired location. TE1000 Version: 1.4.0 15

## Page 16

Integration of the Source Control Management Line IDs are noted at the end of a POU by default. However, these are changes that are not visible in the PLC editors. Therefore, they are displayed in the Project Compare Tool as formal and not substantive changes. So in case of a merge these changes cannot be merged in a meaningful way. In addition, changes in Line IDs also occur when blank lines and comments are inserted and then deleted. Content-wise, the two POUs are the same in the PLC editors, but not in the XML representation of the file, since the Line IDs may have changed. To avoid these disadvantages of Line IDs, it is possible to save Line IDs in a separate file (Separate Line Ids). They are then no longer part of a POU. Starting with Twin CAT version 3.1.4026 it is also possible to completely disable the saving of Line IDs (Write Line Ids). However, this has the disadvantage that all changes in a POU that had no effect on the compilation in the past, e.g. adding blank lines and comments, now require at least one online change. 3.3 Best Practice Note the following points when using Twin CAT 3.1 in co-operation with Source Control systems: • Both the Twin CAT project tree view and the PLC project tree view contain Twin CAT objects whose information is stored in separate files, i.e. not directly in the respective project file. These elements are marked by a small floppy disk in the tree icon. Their contents therefore cannot be accessed in the case of merging the respective project file (files with the extensions *.tsproj and *.plcproj). It is therefore only possible, for example, to add a POU to a PLC project, but the changes inside a POU cannot be accessed. The background to this is that the Source Control Clients do not "look inside" the files that they check out for merging and then also automatically load all the dependencies listed inside them from the Source Control System. • Since Twin CAT objects in the project files are clearly identified with a GUID, it is always necessary to confirm the deletion of an object with a "checkin". For this reason the deletion of an object and the creation of a new object with the same name and the same contents is always a change! • Some objects in the Twin CAT tree require that they are also loaded in the background in order to display them in the tree. Thus all methods, actions, etc. of a POU are also stored in it. For this reason it is a good idea to close a project in Twin CAT first before fetching it again from the Source Control System. 16 Version: 1.4.0 TE1000

Configuration of the Source Control Client 4 Configuration of the Source Control Client Select the Source Control Client as follows: 1. Select the menu Tools -> Options of the Tc Xae Shell. ð The dialog box displays all the settings of the Tc Xae Shell environment. 2. Go to Source Control->Plug-in Selection and select Visual Studio Team Foundation Server. 3. Confirm with OK. Further settings may be required depending on the selected Source Control Management system. They ensure that the Project Compare Tool is called for comparing Twin CAT projects. These settings are generated automatically by the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool for clients of Visual Studio Team Foundation Server and Git. 4.1 Selection of the Compare Tool Following the selection of the Source Control Client to be used in the project, the client must also be configured so that the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool is used to compare and merge Twin CAT files. The configuration of the individual clients can significantly differ. TE1000 Version: 1.4.0 17

## Page 18

Configuration of the Source Control Client Whereas clients such as TFS or Plastics SCM allow different Compare Tools to be defined for the various types of file, there are also clients that only permit a general Compare Tool to be set (e.g. Ankh SVN). Beyond that, Source Control Systems such as Git also allow a distinction to be made between local project settings and global settings. For the Source Control Clients used most frequently with Twin CAT (TFS, Git and Ankh SVN), the configuration of the Compare Tool can be automated from the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool. Since not all features of the different clients can be discussed here, please refer to section Transfer parameters [} 23] of the Project Compare Tool for further details. Define Compare Tools yourself Some clients only allow a general compare/merge tool for all file extensions. For this reason the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool offers the option to define further Compare Tools for special file extensions. See Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with Source Control. Configuration of the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool In order to call the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool from the Twin CAT development environment, the selected Source Control Plugins must be configured accordingly in Tc Xae Shell. Setting the Twin CAT Project Compare Tool as standard tool for Compare-and-Merge functions for subversion Git or Microsoft Team Foundation Server: 1. Open Twin CAT-> Tc Project Compare. 2. Select Tools -> Configure User Tools.... 3. In the following dialog, select a default tool for the Merge. ð This tool is used for all areas outside of the PLC, e.g. for the comparison of specifications for tasks. 4. Click Export Configuration. 18 Version: 1.4.0 TE1000

Configuration of the Source Control Client 5. If the required Source Control Plugin has already been selected in Tc Xae Shell, you can export the specifications for this plugin if you are using Git or Microsoft Team Foundation Server. 6. If you have selected Git as the Source Control Client, you can decide below whether to update the global or project-specific Config file. Also see about this 2 Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control [} 20] TE1000 Version: 1.4.0 19

Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control 5 Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control The configuration of the Tc Project Compare can be generated from the software for use with some of the most frequently used source control clients. At the moment, these are the following clients: • Microsoft Team Foundation Server • Git • Ankh SVN Generating the configuration of these clients To generate the settings for one of the source control clients listed above, proceed as follows: 1. Open Tc Project Compare. 2. Select the menu Tools -> Configure User Tools.... 3. Click on Export Configuration. 20 Version: 1.4.0 TE1000

## Page 21

Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control 4. In the following dialog, select the source control client for which the settings are to be generated from the selection box. 5. In case Git is the source control client, you can select in the following dialog whether you want the settings for the selection of the Compare Tool used to be saved globally or for the specific project. If you save them for the specific project, select the .gitconfig file from your local repository. Then confirm your selection with OK. ð The configuration has been created. Configuring other source control clients: If you use a source control client that is not listed above, you must configure the use of the Tc Project Compare in the respective source control client. To do this, use the transfer parameters listed in the section Transfer parameters of the Tc Project Compare [} 23]. Dealing with non-Twin CAT flies Some clients only allow a general compare/merge tool for all file extensions. For this reason the Twin CAT Project Compare tool offers the option to define further compare tools for special file extensions. Setting an external compare tool for file extensions: 1. Open the Tc Project Compare. TE1000 Version: 1.4.0 21

## Page 22

Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control 2. Select the menu Tools -> Configure User Tools.... 3. Click on Add. 4.

Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control 5.1 Transfer parameters of the Tc Project Compare Since not all special features of the various clients can be dealt with here, the transfer parameters of the Twin CAT Project Compare Tools are briefly described below: Transfer parameters for Twin CAT version 4020 or higher: /filel File path – left side. /filer File path, right side. /filem File path for the merged file. /dl Display name, left side. /dr Display name, right side. /sc Call via source control client. Transfer parameters for Twin CAT versions 4018 or lower: File path – left side. File path, right side. File path of merged file. /dl Display name, left side. /dr Display name, right side. /sc Call via source control client. In Project Compare tool version or lower 4018 the file paths for the left, right and merged file were determined based on the order in which they are called. The order was always left, right, merged file.

Merging Twin CAT PLC projects 6 Merging Twin CAT PLC projects If more than one developer is working on the same PLC project, conflicts may arise when "checking in/ committing" the changes. For example, parallel POUs can be added/edited by more than one developer of the PLC project. These conflicts must be solved if a consistent project is to be created. This procedure for combining changes is called merging. NOTICE Loss of data The "automerge" function (automatic merging) of Source Control Clients can lead to the loss of PLC objects (POUs, GVL, etc.). • Deactivate automatic merging of Source Control Clients • Twin CAT Project Compare Tool must be configured as Merge Tool. See Configuration of the Tc Project Compare for use with source control [} 20]. In case of conflicts when checking in the PLC project, the following dialog appears in the TSF Client: Solve these problems as follows: 1. Select the option Merge Changes In Merge Tool. 2. After merging a PLC project (file extension *. PLCproj), request all files that were added to the PLC project with get latest version. 24 Version: 1.4.0 TE1000
