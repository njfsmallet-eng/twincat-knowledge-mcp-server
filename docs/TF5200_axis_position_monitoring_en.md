Overview 1 Overview Task When a target position is approached, the position monitoring function monitors whether the actual position reaches an exact stop window (tolerance range) within a specific time. If a configurable limit is exceeded, the CNC generates an error message and the axis is stopped. Characteristics The position lag monitor checks the correct functioning of the position controller. For example, this can identify the following problems: • Mechanical changes to axes, e.g. increased friction due to damaged bearings or guides • Errors in the axis position measuring systems Parametrisation The position monitor is configured for each individual axis in the axis parameter list. Mandatory note on references to other documents For the sake of clarity, links to other documents and parameters are abbreviated, e.g. [PROG] for the Programming Manual or P-AXIS-00001 for an axis parameter. For technical reasons, these links only function in the Online Help (HTML5, CHM) but not in pdf files since pdfs do not support cross-linking. 8 Version: 1.06 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Axis position monitoring

Description 2 Description Process Position monitoring consists of the following steps: 1. When the axis command position reaches the programmed target position, the timeout is started (time t ). 1 2. Timeout is deactivated when the actual position of the axis is located within the exact stop window (time t ). The exact stop window is configured by P-AXIS-00236. 2 3. The actual position must be located within the time t configured in P-AXIS-00532 in t the exact stop 3 window. s Exact stop window P-AXIS-00236 Upper limit Target position to be reached Lower limit Time monitoring P-AXIS-00532 t t t t 1 2 3 Contour of t : Start of time monitoring 1 command value t : End of time monitoring 2 t : Maximum time for actual position, Contour of 3 to reach the exact stop window actual value Fig. 1: Position monitoring process Warnings, errors and reactions Error message P-ERR-70082.

Description Recommended parameterisation Position settling time: P-AXIS-00532 = 10000 to 200000µs Exact stop window: P-AXIS-00236 ≥ 3 · ∆s Standstill; ∆S : real position lag at standstill Standstill When exact stop (G60) is programmed, an axis reaches the target position when the actual position is located within the same exact stop window. 10 Version: 1.06 TF5200 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Axis position monitoring

Parameter 3 Parameter 3.1 Overview of parameters ID Description P-AXIS-00236 Position window for exact stop P-AXIS-00532 Maximum permissible time until the exact stop window is reached 3.2 Axis parameters P-AXIS-00236 Position window for exact stop Description A range is defined for the function 'Exact Stop' and contains the axis 'in Position' (|window| ≥ |position lag|). (The related NC command G60 is described in [PROG]. This monitoring is done in position controller if the axis is not interpolated. Parameter getriebe[i].window Data type SGN32 Data range 0 ≤ window ≤ MAX(SGN32) Axis types T, R, S Dimension T: 0.1µm R,S: 0.0001 ° Default value 500 drive types. ---- Remarks P-AXIS-00532 Maximum permissible position settling time for exact stop window Description The parameter defines the maximum permissible settling time. If the window for accuracy stop for not interpolated axes has not been reached within this time an error message will be output. If the parameter is 0, the time monitoring is disabled. With a negative value for this parameter the value of P-AXIS-00151 is used for transient time monitoring (backward compatibility). Parameter getriebe[i].position_settling_time Data type SGN32 Data range MIN(SGN32) ≤ position_settling_time ≤ MAX(SGN32) Axis types T, R, S Dimension T: µs R,S: µs Default value -1 drive types. ---- Remarks This parameter replaces P-AXIS-00151.
