User Interface components 2 User Interface components Twin CAT 3 Engineering consists of various components. The appearance of the user interface is determined by the arrangement and configuration of the individual components. Menu bar Toolbar Editor Window Solution Explorer Properties Window Message Window Toolbox Information and status bar Standard components Menu bar Shows the menus according to the settings in the Customize dialog. Toolbar Shows the commands as buttons identified with symbols according to the settings in the Customize dialog. Toolbox Shows the “tools” that are available for the currently active editor (e.g., graphical programming elements) Solution Explorer Shows the Twin CAT 3 project with the associated project elements in a structured form. Properties Window Shows the properties of the element that is currently selected in the Solution Explorer. Editor Window This is used for defining and editing objects. For language editors (e.g., ST editor, CFC editor), the editor window usually shows the language editor in the lower part (implementation part) and the declaration editor in the upper part. For other editors, the editor window may also contain dialogs (e.g., task editor, device editor). The following components provide information about the current processes in the project in offline or online mode: Message Window Shows current errors, warnings, and messages relating to syntax check, compile process etc. Monitoring window and online Used for monitoring a POU or a user-defined list of expressions/variables. views of editors Information and status bar Shows the status of the Twin CAT 3 runtime. If an editor window is currently active, the current cursor position and the set editing mode are displayed. In online mode you see the current program status. 16 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

## Page 17

User Interface components Certain standard settings are installed with Twin CAT, which determine the appearance, structure and behavior of the standard components and thus the user interface. The section “Configuring user interface [} 34]” describes how you can edit the standard settings in order to individually adapt the user interface. Section “Reference user interface [} 50]” provides detailed information on the commands. Displayed status of the Twin CAT 3 runtime In addition to the current operation mode of the Twin CAT 3 runtime (Run mode or Config mode) the quality of the connection to the selected Twin CAT 3 runtime is displayed. The evaluation of the connection quality is always referenced to the currently set connection timeout. The set timeout is divided into micro-timeouts and repetitions. This results in the following: Set connection timeout = micro-timeouts * number of repetitions. For the division between micro-timeout and repetitions, there is a case distinction: If the set connection timeout >= 30 s, then micro-timeout = 5 s repetitions = set connection timeout / 5 If the set connection timeout >= 10 s, then micro-timeout = 2 s repetitions = set connection timeout / 2 Otherwise: micro-timeout = 500 ms, repetitions = set connection timeout *2 After each micro-timeout, a fresh attempt is made to communicate with the target system. No error message is output. This information is used among other things to evaluate the quality of the connection with the target system. The following 3 levels exist here: TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 17

## Page 18

User Interface components Yellow bar: connection quality is good: fewer than ¼ of the micro-timeouts have expired. Orange bar: 1st warning level: ¼ of the micro-timeouts have expired. red bar: 2nd warning level: half of the micro-timeouts have expired. Flashing behavior The display flashes in the colors explained here to indicate the micro- timeouts. 2.1 Standard menus The menu bar is visible by default. It contains the main menus shown in the screenshot. The context menu of the Twin CAT project can be called as standard. 2.2 Standard toolbars The toolbars provide quick access to the commands.

Views A "view" is a window within the main window of the user interface that is independent of a PLC object. Views are characterized by the following properties: • They can be opened via the View menu. • They usually contain a non-configurable toolbar with buttons for sorting, viewing and searching within the view. • They can be docked to the frame of the main window or positioned anywhere on the screen. • They can be hidden and represented only by a tab in the main window. The following views are open by default: • Solution Explorer • Error List • Output • Toolbox • Properties window Window A "window" is dependent on a PLC object. Windows are characterized by the following properties: • They can be opened via the Window menu or by double-clicking on the object. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 27

## Page 28

User Interface components • They are all arranged in a particular area of the user interface as MDI windows in the form of tabs. The arrangement of the windows depends on the user-specific settings. • They cannot be hidden. • They are not open by default. Examples: • Editor window for PLC objects 2.5 Information bar The information bar shows the current cursor position and the edit mode as well as the mode of the Twin CAT 3 Runtime, depending on which view or window is active. Cursor position The current cursor position is displayed when an editor window is active. Current cursor position, starting from the left or top of the editor window: L (Ln) Line number C (Col) Column number (a column contains exactly one space, letter or digit) Chr (Ch) Number of characters (a character may refer to a single letter, a single digit, or even a tab range, which may cover 4 columns, for example) Double-clicking on one of the fields opens the Go To Line dialog. Here you can specify a line in which the cursor should be placed. Edit mode The current editing mode is displayed when an editor window is active. Currently set editing mode: INS insert mode OVR overwrite mode Double-click the field to change the setting. Twin CAT system state You can recognize the state of the Twin CAT system by the color of the Twin CAT system service icon in the system tray. The following states are possible: Twin CAT 3 Runtime is in Config mode Twin CAT 3 Runtime is in Run mode Twin CAT 3 Runtime is in Stop mode Twin CAT 3 Runtime is in Exception mode Flashing behavior indicates the micro-timeouts [} 16]. 28 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

In addition to important runtime commands for starting and stopping the runtime, the menu contains commands for accessing the router settings and the communication between engineering and runtime. The router commands are especially important when engineering and runtime are on separate computers. The engineering environment can also be started directly via the Twin CAT system menu. Open the system menu by right-clicking on the Twin CAT system service icon in the system tray. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 29

## Page 30

User Interface components 2.7.1 About Twin CAT… The Twin CAT System dialog lists all the essential data of the installed Twin CAT version. This can be copied to the clipboard or emailed to the Twin CAT support hotline, as required. 2.7.2 Realtime 30 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

## Page 31

User Interface components Time base Timebase for calculating the percentage. Currently, a fixed timebase of 1 millisecond is set. CPU Usage/Limit The slider can be used to allocate processor time to the Twin CAT real-time system. Currently, a timebase of 1 millisecond is set. In the example shown, Twin CAT is allocated a maximum of 80 % of the computing time. With a timebase of 1 ms, this means that Twin CAT has a maximum of 800 µs available per millisecond. It also means that at least 200 μs remain for Windows. When the Twin CAT real-time system switches to its idle task, the processor is returned to Windows. The slider bar shows the current utilization of the real-time system. The display is averaged over 256 cycles (ms). System latency This shows the current and maximum latency time in the real-time system. The time by which the central system tick is delayed is measured. The maximum time is stored until the slider is operated or the dialog is exited. The latency time is, of course, also measured when the dialog is not open. If the set maximum time is exceeded, a message is displayed once in the window, and a logbook entry is created. By calling up the dialog, the message can be reset so that a message is displayed again when the next timeout occurs. 2.7.3 Router Info Memory The displayed RAM is required in the Twin CAT system for AMS messages and for memory management in the Twin CAT real-time environment. The entire memory is requested by Windows when the Twin CAT system starts up. The memory size can be configured in the Twin CAT system node. Over all RAM that was available when the Twin CAT system was started. Available RAM that is currently available for Twin CAT. Registered All devices taking part in the Twin CAT messaging system (AMS) have to register with the router. Twin CAT servers have fixed port numbers (e.g. Twin CAT PLC LZS1: 851, …). Twin CAT clients are assigned a port number by the message router. Ports Number of registered ports Drivers Ports occupied by Twin CAT servers Transports Number of registered devices (Net IDs) Mail debugging In conjunction with the Twin CAT ADS Monitor, the whole Twin CAT message traffic can be logged. Note that the message traffic is slowed down by the additional messages. The Twin CAT ADS Monitor is not part of the standard scope of supply of Twin CAT. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 31

## Page 32

User Interface components Cleanup The cleanup function of the router can be used to release router ports originating from programs that are no longer functional. This function is particularly useful in the development phase of PLC projects. Changing the AMS Net ID Local computer AMS Net ID The AMS Net ID is the address of the local computer in the Twin CAT network. The AMS Net ID consists of 6 bytes and is represented in a dot notation. The “Net IDs” must be assigned by the project planner and must not be repeated in the Twin CAT network. By default, the installation generates an AMS Net ID from the IP address of the system (if available) + “1.1”. If no IP address can be determined during the installation, the AMS Net ID “1.1.1.1.1.1” is created. Editing routes The Twin CAT Static Routes dialog shows all the route information of the local Twin CAT system. The Add button can be used to add new routes. You can find more information in the Basics documentation in the Routes chapter. 2.7.4 System If the Twin CAT system is not configured for automatic startup, you can start it manually via the system menu. Start/Restart The Twin CAT system is started. All Twin CAT servers that were entered are loaded and initialized. The Twin CAT I/O subsystem is parameterized by the Twin CAT I/O Manager, according to the configuration. All runtime systems of the PLC subsystem that were entered are initialized. If a boot project is entered for a runtime system, it is loaded and the PLC program is started. The remanent (retain) data is also loaded according to the configuration. Config The Twin CAT system is stopped. All Twin CAT servers that were entered are shut down and unloaded. Once the Twin CAT system has stopped, only the Twin CAT Message Router remains in the memory. The Twin CAT system can now be started again via System > Start. 2.7.5 Tools Tool Description Event Viewer Opens the Windows Event Viewer, in which system errors are entered Twin CAT Project Opens an application program for comparing or merging Twin CAT projects Compare See: Documentation Source Control > Introduction Twin CAT Switch Runtime Opens an application program for switching the Twin CAT runtime environment between Twin CAT 2 and Twin CAT 3 32 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

Reference User Interface Possible scenarios when opening a PLC project The following scenarios are possible when you open a project: 1. Another project is still open. [} 54] 2. The project was saved with an older version of Twin CAT 3. [} 54] 3. The project was not saved with Twin CAT 3. [} 54] 4. The project was not terminated properly and "Save automatically" was enabled. [} 55] 5. The project is read-only. [} 55] 6. It is a library that is installed in a library repository and retrieved from it. [} 56] 1. Another project is still open. You are asked if the other project should be saved and closed. 2. The project was saved with an older version of Twin CAT 3. If the file format differs because the open project was saved with an older version of Twin CAT 3, there are two options: • If the project cannot be saved in the format of the currently used programming system, you must update it to continue working on the project. The expression that appears at this point: The changes you made... refers to internal tasks of various components while the project is loaded. • If the project can still be saved in the previous format, you can decide whether to update or retain the format. If you decide to retain the format, data loss may occur. If you decide to update the format, the project can no longer be opened with the old version of the programming system. In addition to the file format, the versions of the explicitly inserted libraries, the visualization profile and the compiler version of the opening project may differ from those installed with the current programming system. If newer versions are installed on the current programming system, the Project Environment dialog opens automatically, where you can update the versions. If no update is made at this point, this can be done later at any time via the Options > Project Environment dialog. Note the compiler version If a project is opened that was created with an older version of the programming system and for which the latest compiler version is set in the project settings, while the project environment setting for the compiler version is set to Do not update in the new programming system, the compiler version that was used last in the old project continues to be used (i.e. not the "Current" version in the new environment). 3. The project was not saved with Twin CAT 3. Case 1) If you set the file filter when selecting the project to be opened and an appropriate converter is available, the converter is used automatically and the project is brought into the current format. The conversion is converter-specific. Usually, you are prompted to define the handling of referenced libraries or device references. Twin CAT 3 converter Adaptation of a Twin CAT PLC control project to the Twin CAT 3 syntax can only be successful during import if the converter is able to compile the project without errors. If you have set the All Files option when selecting the project to be opened, no converter is enabled and the Convert Project dialog opens. In the dialog, you need to explicitly trigger the conversion of the project by selecting one of the options. • Convert to the current format: Select the converter you want to use from the selection list (application for conversion). After the conversion, the project can no longer be opened in the old version. 54 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

Reference User Interface • Create a new project and add a specific device: (Not yet implemented) Twin CAT 2.x PLC Control project options The project directory path set in the Twin CAT 2.x PLC control project options and the project information are adopted in the Project Information dialog. Case 2) If libraries are integrated in the project for which "conversion mapping" has not yet been stored in the library options, the Converting a library reference dialog appears, in which you can define how this reference should be converted: • Convert and install the library: If you select this option, the referenced library is converted to the new format and remains referenced in the project. It is automatically installed in the library repository under the Other category and continues to be used. If the library does not have the project information (title, version) required for an installation, you will be prompted to enter it in the Enter Project Information dialog. • Use the following library, which is already installed: If you select the options, the referenced library is replaced by another one that is already installed on the local system. Use the Select button to open the Select... dialog. Here you can select the desired version of one of the installed libraries. This corresponds to the configuration of the version handling in the Library Properties dialog. An asterisk ("*") means that, as a rule, the latest version of the library available on the system is used in the project. The list of available libraries is structured in the same way as in the Library Repository dialog. You can sort the list by company and category. • Ignore the library. The reference will not appear in the converted project: If you enable this option, the library reference is removed. The library is then no longer included in the converted project. • Use this mapping in future if this library is present: If you enable this option, the settings made here in the dialog will also be applied to future project conversions, as soon as the respective library is referenced. In the converted project, the library references are defined in the Global Library Manager in the Solution Explorer. After the conversion of the library references, the project conversion continues with the Open Project dialog, as described above. For general information on library management, see section “Using libraries” in the PLC documentation. Case 3) When you open a Twin CAT 2.x PLC Control project that references a device (target system) for which no "conversion mapping" has yet been defined in the Twin CAT 2.x PLC Control converter options, the Device Conversion dialog opens, in which you can specify whether and how the old device references are to be replaced by more recent ones. The device originally used is displayed. Choose one of the following options: • Use the following already installed device: Click the Select button to open the Select target system dialog, in which you can select one of the devices currently installed on the system. This device is then inserted in the Solution Explorer of the converted project, instead of the old one. Select the option Select a target system... to select one of the devices listed. The list of available devices is structured in the same way as in the Device Repository dialog. You can sort the list by manufacturer or by category. • Ignore the device. No application-specific objects will be available: If you enable this option, no entry for the device is created in the Solution Explorer of the new project, i.e. the device is ignored during the conversion, and no application-specific objects, such as the task configuration, are applied. • Save this assignment for future reference: If you select this option, all settings of the dialog, i.e. the displayed "conversion mapping" for the device, are saved in the Twin CAT 2.x PLC Control Converter options and applied to future conversions. 4. The project was not terminated properly and "Save automatically" was enabled. If the Auto Save function was enabled in the Load and Save options and Twin CAT 3 PLC was not terminated regularly after the last modification of the project without saving, the Auto Save Backup dialog opens for handling the backup copy. 5. The project is read-only. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 55

Reference User Interface Plc Templates Select one of the listed templates. The template determines the basic configuration of a PLC project file. The following templates are available by default: • Standard PLC Project: Creates a new Twin CAT PLC project (*.project). The project is supported by a wizard and contains a Library Manager, a POU "MAIN" program and a referenced task. • Empty PLC Project: Creates an "empty" Twin CAT PLC project for library projects (*.library). The project contains no objects or devices. Name Define the name of the new project here. The default name depends on the selected template (usually "Unnamed<n>") and contains a sequential number to ensure that the project name is unique in the file system. You can change the default name according to the file path conventions of the local operating system. A file extension (e.g. .project) can be added. By default, the selected template automatically adds the appropriate extension. Location Specify the location for the new project file. The default path depends on the selected template. You can either use the Browse... button to open the default browser and specify a path, or you can use the corresponding drop-down list to select a previously entered path. Add Clicking Add creates a new project based on your settings. If the cursor is placed on an error symbol, a tooltip provides information on how to proceed. If another PLC project is already open, a dialog opens asking you if you want to save and close the project before the new project is opened. The name of the new project is then displayed in the title bar of the Twin CAT XAE frame window. An asterisk ("*") after the name indicates that the project has been modified since it was last saved.

Reference User Interface Possible scenarios when opening a PLC project The following scenarios are possible when you open a project: 1. Another project is still open. [} 88] 2. The project was saved with an older version of Twin CAT 3. [} 88] 3. The project was not saved with Twin CAT 3. [} 88] 4. The project was not terminated properly and "Save automatically" was enabled. [} 89] 5. The project is read-only. [} 89] 6. It is a library that is installed in a library repository and retrieved from it. [} 90] 1. Another project is still open. You are asked if the other project should be saved and closed. 2. The project was saved with an older version of Twin CAT 3. If the file format differs because the open project was saved with an older version of Twin CAT 3, there are two options: • If the project cannot be saved in the format of the currently used programming system, you must update it to continue working on the project. The expression that appears at this point: The changes you made... refers to internal tasks of various components while the project is loaded. • If the project can still be saved in the previous format, you can decide whether to update or retain the format. If you decide to retain the format, data loss may occur. If you decide to update the format, the project can no longer be opened with the old version of the programming system. In addition to the file format, the versions of the explicitly inserted libraries, the visualization profile and the compiler version of the opening project may differ from those installed with the current programming system. If newer versions are installed on the current programming system, the Project Environment dialog opens automatically, where you can update the versions. If no update is made at this point, this can be done later at any time via the Options > Project Environment dialog. Note the compiler version If a project is opened that was created with an older version of the programming system and for which the latest compiler version is set in the project settings, while the project environment setting for the compiler version is set to Do not update in the new programming system, the compiler version that was used last in the old project continues to be used (i.e. not the "Current" version in the new environment). 3. The project was not saved with Twin CAT 3. Case 1) If you set the file filter when selecting the project to be opened and an appropriate converter is available, the converter is used automatically and the project is brought into the current format. The conversion is converter-specific. Usually, you are prompted to define the handling of referenced libraries or device references. Twin CAT 3 converter Adaptation of a Twin CAT PLC control project to the Twin CAT 3 syntax can only be successful during import if the converter is able to compile the project without errors. If you have set the All Files option when selecting the project to be opened, no converter is enabled and the Convert Project dialog opens. In the dialog, you need to explicitly trigger the conversion of the project by selecting one of the options. • Convert to the current format: Select the converter you want to use from the selection list (application for conversion). After the conversion, the project can no longer be opened in the old version. 88 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

Reference User Interface • Create a new project and add a specific device: (Not yet implemented) Twin CAT 2.x PLC Control project options The project directory path set in the Twin CAT 2.x PLC control project options and the project information are adopted in the Project Information dialog. Case 2) If libraries are integrated in the project for which "conversion mapping" has not yet been stored in the library options, the Converting a library reference dialog appears, in which you can define how this reference should be converted: • Convert and install the library: If you select this option, the referenced library is converted to the new format and remains referenced in the project. It is automatically installed in the library repository under the Other category and continues to be used. If the library does not have the project information (title, version) required for an installation, you will be prompted to enter it in the Enter Project Information dialog. • Use the following library, which is already installed: If you select the options, the referenced library is replaced by another one that is already installed on the local system. Use the Select button to open the Select... dialog. Here you can select the desired version of one of the installed libraries. This corresponds to the configuration of the version handling in the Library Properties dialog. An asterisk ("*") means that, as a rule, the latest version of the library available on the system is used in the project. The list of available libraries is structured in the same way as in the Library Repository dialog. You can sort the list by company and category. • Ignore the library. The reference will not appear in the converted project: If you enable this option, the library reference is removed. The library is then no longer included in the converted project. • Use this mapping in future if this library is present: If you enable this option, the settings made here in the dialog will also be applied to future project conversions, as soon as the respective library is referenced. In the converted project, the library references are defined in the Global Library Manager in the Solution Explorer. After the conversion of the library references, the project conversion continues with the Open Project dialog, as described above. For general information on library management, see section “Using libraries” in the PLC documentation. Case 3) When you open a Twin CAT 2.x PLC Control project that references a device (target system) for which no "conversion mapping" has yet been defined in the Twin CAT 2.x PLC Control converter options, the Device Conversion dialog opens, in which you can specify whether and how the old device references are to be replaced by more recent ones. The device originally used is displayed. Choose one of the following options: • Use the following already installed device: Click the Select button to open the Select target system dialog, in which you can select one of the devices currently installed on the system. This device is then inserted in the Solution Explorer of the converted project, instead of the old one. Select the option Select a target system... to select one of the devices listed. The list of available devices is structured in the same way as in the Device Repository dialog. You can sort the list by manufacturer or by category. • Ignore the device. No application-specific objects will be available: If you enable this option, no entry for the device is created in the Solution Explorer of the new project, i.e. the device is ignored during the conversion, and no application-specific objects, such as the task configuration, are applied. • Save this assignment for future reference: If you select this option, all settings of the dialog, i.e. the displayed "conversion mapping" for the device, are saved in the Twin CAT 2.x PLC Control Converter options and applied to future conversions. 4. The project was not terminated properly and "Save automatically" was enabled. If the Auto Save function was enabled in the Load and Save options and Twin CAT 3 PLC was not terminated regularly after the last modification of the project without saving, the Auto Save Backup dialog opens for handling the backup copy. 5. The project is read-only. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 89

It is a library that is installed in a library repository and retrieved from it. An error message is displayed if you try and open a library project that is installed in a library repository. You cannot open a library project using this path. After closing the dialog with OK, the project name appears in the title bar of the user interface. An asterisk ("*") after the name indicates that the project has been modified since it was last saved.

## Page 91

Reference User Interface Always bind True: The object is selected in the compiler and therefore always included in the compile information. It is therefore always compiled and loaded onto the PLC. This option becomes relevant if the object is located below an application or referenced via libraries that are also located below an application. The compile information is also used as a basis for the selectable variables of the symbol configuration. Alternatively, the {attribute 'linkalways'} pragma can be used to instruct the compiler to always include an object. Compiler definitions The compiler definitions entered here are not evaluated. If you want to use compiler definitions, enter them in the PLC project properties. See: • Command properties (PLC project) > Category Compile [} 98] • PLC documentation: Reference Programming > Pragmas > Conditional pragmas Exclude from compilation True: The object is not included in the next compilation run. External implementation (Late binding in the runtime system) The use of this functionality is only possible in special constellations. As a rule, you can ignore this option. True: No code is generated for this object when the project is compiled. The object is not linked until the project is loaded to the target system, provided it exists there (in the PLC runtime system or in another real-time module). Image In this area you can assign an image to the object, which is displayed in the graphical view of the library manager and in the toolbox of the FBD/LD/IL editor. Transparency of the image can be achieved by selecting a color, which is then displayed transparently. If you select the option Transparency Color, you can use the rectangular button to the right of it to open the standard dialog for selecting a color. Licenses This section contains a list of licenses for the object. General In this section you will find general information about the selected object. File Name File/object name Full Path Storage path/location of the object (not editable at this point) Version File version, values: • 1.1.0.1: This file version is used when the object is saved in XML format. • 1.2.0.0: This file version is used when the object is saved in Base64 format. Please note that objects with file version 1.2.0.0 (or higher) cannot be loaded with Engineering versions lower than TC3.1.4024!

Reference User Interface Engineering incompatibility of file version 1.2.0.0 (or higher) with Twin CAT 3.1 < build 4024 Please note that objects saved with file version 1.2.0.0 (or higher) cannot be loaded with Engineering versions lower than Twin CAT 3.1.4024! Since an object is automatically saved with file version 1.2.0.0 when using the optional Base64 format, objects with Base64 format cannot be loaded with Engineering versions lower than Twin CAT 3.1.4024. If a PLC project contains objects with the file version 1.1.0.1 and objects with the file version 1.2.0.0, the 1.1.0.1 objects are loaded with an Engineering version lower than Twin CAT 3.1.4024. Objects with file version 1.2.0.0 are not loaded. The file version of a file saved with file version 1.2.0.0 can be reset to 1.1.0.1 using XAE version Twin CAT 3.1.4024 or higher.

Reference User Interface Format Individual setting option of the storage format: The storage format of an object can be individually configured at this point for the object types listed below. Storage format, values: • XML: The object is saved in XML format. ◦ Objects with this storage format are stored in file version 1.1.0.1, see Version property. • Base64: The object is saved in Base64 format. ◦ Objects with this storage format are stored in file version 1.2.0.0, see Version property. Please note that objects with file version 1.2.0.0 (or higher) cannot be loaded with Engineering versions lower than TC3.1.4024! Advantages of Base64 over XML: Base64 results in compressed storage, compared to XML. As a result, improved performance can be achieved with file access to these objects, which can be used, for example, when loading, moving or copying objects. Availability of Base64: The Base64 storage format is optionally available from build 4024 for the following PLC objects: • POUs where the POU body is programmed in a graphical implementation language ◦ Sequential Function Chart (SFC) ◦ FBD/LD/IL (Function Block Diagram/Ladder Diagram/Instruction List) ◦ CFC (Continuous Function Chart and page-oriented CFC) ◦ UML class diagram and Statechart • POUs with a subelement (e.g. action, method) that is programmed in a graphical implementation language (for graphical languages see first key point) • Visualizations • Visualization Manager • Text lists • Recipe manager • Image pool Setting option for the standard storage format: For a PLC project, the setting "Write object content as" in the PLC project properties (Category Advanced [} 108]) can be used to define the standard storage format for the object types mentioned above. Separate Line Ids Value: True or False • True: The line IDs of this POU are stored in a separate file (Line IDs.dbg). • False: The line IDs of this POU are stored in the POU itself. (not editable at this point, configurable in the Write options [} 185]) Sort Value: Name or GUID Specifies the sequence in which the child objects (such as methods) are stored in the parent object: either sorted by name or by GUID. (not editable at this point, configurable in the Write options [} 185]) Write Product Version Value: True or False (not editable at this point, configurable via the setting "Write product version in files" in the Category Advanced [} 108] of the PLC project properties) TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 93

Reference User Interface SFC settings This area displays the current settings for compiling and handling implicit variables for the currently selected SFC object. Use default SFC settings True (default): With this option, the default values defined in the PLC project properties [} 102] can be applied to the currently selected object and displayed in the Properties view of the object. False: This option allows you to configure SFC settings that are valid specifically for this SFC object. Calculate active transitions only True: Twin CAT generates code only for transitions that are currently active. False (default): Twin CAT generates code for all transitions. The states of all transitions are displayed online in color (True in dark blue, False in light blue). SFC flags Implicitly generated variables (Flags) for controlling and monitoring the processing in an SFC diagram. Use: The corresponding variable is used. Declare: The corresponding variable is created automatically. Use Declare: The variable is created and used. CFC settings Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 This area sets the execution order mode for the selected CFC object. In the CFC editor, you freely position the elements and thus the networks. To avoid that the execution order in the CFC programming block is undefined, two modes are available. 94 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

## Page 95

Reference User Interface Explicit Execution Order False (default): Automatic data flow mode True: Explicit execution order mode Automatic data flow mode In this mode, the execution order is automatically set according to data flow and, in case of ambiguity, according to network topology. The programming blocks and the outputs are numbered internally. The upper networks are executed before the lower networks and the left networks before the right networks. Advantage: The automatically defined execution order is time and cycle optimized. You do not need any information about the internally managed execution order even during the development process. The elements in the CFC editor are displayed without marks and without numbering. It is not possible to change the execution order manually. For networks with feedback, you can additionally set a starting point. In the menu CFC > Execution order the following commands are available in this mode: • Command Display Execution Order [} 205] • Command Set Start of Feedback [} 205] Explicit execution order mode In this mode you can explicitly set the execution order. For this purpose, the elements are displayed in the CFC editor with marks and numbering, and menu commands are provided that allow you to determine the order. The following commands are available in the menu CFC > Execution order: • Command Move to Beginning [} 206] • Command Move to End [} 206] • Command Forward by one [} 206] • Command Back by one [} 207] • Command Set Execution Order [} 207] • Command Order by Data Flow [} 208] • Command Order By Topology [} 208] Until build 4026, this was the usual behavior of CFC programming blocks. Note that you must adjust the execution order on your own responsibility and judge the consequences and effects yourself. The execution order is constantly displayed for this purpose. 5.4.4 Command Properties (PLC project) Symbol: Function: This command opens an editor window in which the properties of the project and additional project-related information can be displayed and defined. Call: Context menu of the PLC project object (<PLC project name> Project) or Project menu Requirement: A project is open. Twin CAT stores the PLC project properties directly in the PLC project. Scope of PLC project properties Note that the scope differs between different project properties! Some properties affect only the PLC project whose properties you are currently configuring. Other properties, on the other hand, affect all PLC projects in the development environment. Such properties, which you can change in the project properties of a PLC project, but which also affect all other PLC projects, are titled Solution options. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 95

Reference User Interface See also: • PLC documentation: Configuring a project 5.4.4.1 Category Common The category Common contains general information and meta information of the project file. Twin CAT uses this information to create keys in the Properties tab. For example, if the Company text field contains the name "Company_A", the Properties tab contains the Company key with the value "Company_A". Project information For a library project, a company, title and version must be entered in order to be able to install the library. Company Name of the company, which created this project (application or library). In addition to the library category, it is used for sorting in the library repository Title Project title Version Project version, e.g. "0.0.0.1" Released : Protection against modification enabled. Consequence: When you now edit the project, a prompt will appear asking you if you really want to change the project. If you answer this query once with Yes, the prompt will no longer appear when the project is edited again. Library Categories Categories of the library project by which you can sort in the Library Repository dialog. If no category is specified, the library is assigned the category "Other". To assign it to another category, the category must be defined. Library categories are defined in one or several external description files in XML format. To assign the library, you can either call such a file or another library file that has already picked up information about the categories from a description file. Requirement: The project is a library project. The Library Categories dialog opens, in which you can add library categories. Default namespace The default setting for the namespace of a library is the library title. Alternatively, a different namespace can be defined explicitly, either generally for the library in the project information during library generation, or in the Properties dialog of the library reference for local use of the library in a project. The namespace of the library must be used as prefix of the identifier, in order to enable unambiguous access to a module that exists more than once in the project, or if the use of this prefix is enforced by the library property Language Model Attribute "qualified-access-only" ("Unambiguous access to library modules or variables"). If you do not define a standard namespace here, the name of the library file is automatically used as the namespace. Placeholder At this point, a default name for the placeholder can be specified, which represents or references this library. If a placeholder is not specified explicitly at this point, the default setting for the placeholder name of a library corresponds to the library title.

In this case, a message window appears containing a Details button. Use this button to open the Application information window, which allows you to check the differences between the current PLC project and the PLC project on the controller. This involves comparing the number of function blocks, the data and the storage locations. The Application information window contains a brief description of the differences, for example: • Declaration of MAIN changed • Variable fb My New Instance inserted in MAIN • Number of methods/actions of FB_Sample changed (Default): If this setting is enabled, the information on the contents of the PLC project is loaded onto the PLC. This enables an extended check of the differences between the current PLC project and the PLC project on the controller. The difference in the extended check option is that the Application information window contains an additional Online comparison tab, which shows a tree comparison view. This will tell you which POUs have been changed, deleted or added.

(Default): When the PLC project is created, no tpy file associated with the project is created. : When the PLC project is created, a tpy file associated with the project is created and stored in the project folder. Please note that the value and configuration availability of this option depends on whether or not the TPY file is configured as a target file (see Settings tab [} 116]). • If the TPY file is enabled as a target file, the following happens: ◦ Twin CAT remembers the current status of the "Generate tpy file" option (= "original value", see below.). ◦ If this is not already the case, the option "Generate tpy file" is automatically activated next time the project is created. ◦ In addition, the "Generate tpy file" option is grayed out so that it cannot be disabled by the user as long as the TPY file is configured as a target file. • If the TPY file is subsequently disabled as a target file, the following happens: ◦ Next time the project is created, the "Generate tpy file" option is assigned its "original value" (see above.). ◦ In addition, the option is no longer grayed out, making it available again for configuration by the user. Add initialization values Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026.12 of declarations to the TMC file (Default): Initialization values of declarations are saved in the TMC file. This is useful, for example, if the initialization values are required for other applications. : Initialization values of declarations are not saved in the TMC file. This reduces the size of the TMC file and the compilation time, especially if the declarations in the PLC project contain a large number of initialization values. Sample: VAR a Sample : ARRAY[1..10] OF INT := [2, 38, 5, 9, 74, 62, 87, 3, 16, 4]; END_VAR Add comments on POU Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 and DUT declarations to the TMC file (Default): Comments on POUs and DUTs that are above their declaration are saved with the data type in the TMC file. This is useful, for example, if the comments are required for other applications. : Comments above the declaration of POUs and DUTs are not saved in the TMC file. This reduces the size of the TMC file and the compilation time, especially if the comments contain detailed descriptions of the POUs and DUTs.

Reference User Interface Compiler Version Available up to Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 Defines the compiler version that Twin CAT uses during compilation and during loading for compilation. Please note that this setting does not replace the Remote Manager. For handling different engineering versions, if the PLC project is an application project, the Remote Manager should always be used. The compiler version should always be set to "latest" in this case. The compiler version setting is only relevant if the PLC project to be version- managed is a library project.. It is recommended that the library is saved with the oldest version with which it is ultimately to be used. To this end, the compiler version must be set to the corresponding fixed version (e.g. "3.1.4018.0"). Maximum number of Refers to the maximum number of warnings that Twin CAT issues in the Error warnings List view. The selection of displayed compiler warnings is defined in the category Compiler warnings in the Project Settings dialog. Replace constants : Twin CAT loads the value directly for each constant of scalar type, i.e. not for STRING, ARRAY or structures. In online mode, Twin CAT identifies the constants in the declaration editor or monitoring window with a symbol preceding the value. In this case, access via an ADR operator, forcing or writing, for example, is not possible. (Default): Access to constants is possible. The computing time increases slightly.

Write options Engineering incompatibility of file version 1.2.0.0 (or higher) with Twin CAT 3.1 < build 4024 Please note that objects saved with file version 1.2.0.0 (or higher) cannot be loaded with Engineering versions lower than Twin CAT 3.1.4024! Since an object is automatically saved with file version 1.2.0.0 when using the optional Base64 format, objects with Base64 format cannot be loaded with Engineering versions lower than Twin CAT 3.1.4024. If a PLC project contains objects with the file version 1.1.0.1 and objects with the file version 1.2.0.0, the 1.1.0.1 objects are loaded with an Engineering version lower than Twin CAT 3.1.4024. Objects with file version 1.2.0.0 are not loaded.

Reference User Interface Write object content as Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 ("Write object content Background information: as") From Build 4024, Base64 introduces a new storage format that is optionally available for the following PLC objects: • POUs where the POU body is programmed in a graphical implementation language ◦ Sequential Function Chart (SFC) ◦ FBD/LD/IL (Function Block Diagram/Ladder Diagram/Instruction List) ◦ CFC (Continuous Function Chart and page-oriented CFC) ◦ UML class diagram and state diagram • POUs with a subelement (e.g. action, method) that is programmed in a graphical implementation language (for graphical languages see first key point) • Visualizations • Visualization Manager • Text lists • Recipe manager • Image pool Up to now, these objects were saved as XML by default. From Build 4024 you can configure whether these object types should be saved as XML or Base64. Advantages of Base64 over XML: Base64 results in compressed storage, compared to XML. As a result, improved performance can be achieved with file access to these objects, which can be used, for example, when loading projects or moving/copying objects. Setting option for the standard storage format: For a PLC project, the setting "Write object content as" in the PLC project properties can be used to define the default storage format for the object types mentioned above. The selected standard storage format is only used with newly added objects (exception: not with newly added POU sub-objects. Example: A POU is saved as an XML and the standard storage format is configured as Base64. If a graphic sub-object is then added to the POU, the storage format of the POU and thus of the sub-object as XML remains unchanged). The storage format of an existing object with a non-standard storage format is not automatically changed when the object is changed and saved. The storage format of an existing object can be changed individually via the Properties window (see below). Alternatively, when changing the standard storage format, there is the option of adopting the newly selected storage format for all existing objects. If you change the storage format at this point, a corresponding query window appears. The following options are available for the setting "Write object content as": • XML (Default): The PLC objects mentioned above are saved in XML format by default. ◦ Objects with this storage format are stored in file version 1.1.0.1. • Base64: The PLC objects mentioned above are saved in Base64 format by default. ◦ Objects with this storage format are stored in file version 1.2.0.0. Please note that objects with the file version 1.2.0.0 (or higher) cannot be loaded with Engineering versions < Twin CAT 3.1.4024! Individual setting option of the storage format: The storage format of an object can be configured individually for the object types mentioned above in the Properties window of the object.

Reference User Interface Write product version in Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 files The product version indicates which plug-in version was used to save a PLC file ("Write product version in (e.g. a function block). The setting of this checkbox is valid for the whole project files") and is the default setting for all modified or newly added PLC objects located in this PLC project. (Default): The product or plugin version is not written to the file. • If you change the setting from enabled to disabled, a query window appears in which you can select whether to remove the product version from all existing files. • Use case for the disabled option: This setting can be used if the product version is not of interest. This minimizes changes to files with regard to source code management systems. The product or plugin version is written into the file (the version is not visible in XAE; it shows up if the file is analyzed at file level). • If you change the setting from disabled to enabled, a query window appears in which you can select whether to add the product version to all existing files. • Use case for the enabled option: This setting can be used to include the file version in the file for debugging or tracking purposes, for example. • Note the following: If the file is saved with a different product version, this leads to a change of this file, which shows up as a file difference when using source code management systems. Write object content with The profile defines the format in which objects are saved. With Build 4024, for profile example, new functionalities were added for the PLC HMI. For this reason, visualization files saved with Build 4024 cannot be directly opened with older builds. If you set a 4022 profile here, then the visualization files will be saved in the appropriate format and can be opened with Build 4022. Requirement: So that, for example, the 4022 profile is available in the drop-down menu, either a 4022 Remote Manager installation must be carried out or the current 4024 XAE installation must have been installed via a previously existing 4022 XAE installation. Write Bookmarks to File Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 (Default): The bookmarks are only saved in the .suo file from Visual Studio. A .bookmarks file that has already been created is deleted from the project directory. : The stored bookmarks are also written from the Visual Studio project user options file (.suo) to a separate file. This file ends with .bookmarks and is located in the project directory. It is then also part of the known archive options. The global default setting for new PLC projects as to whether bookmarks should be stored in a separate file can be found at Dialog Options - Write Options [} 185].

For more information on library management, see section Using libraries. Information about source code encryption can be found in the documentation on Security Management. Target Files In the Target Files group box you can set which information is transferred to the folder \Boot\Plc when you create a boot project on the target system. TMC File TMC file (Twin CAT Module Class) of a PLC project TPY File TPY file (contains, among other information, project information, routing information, compiler information, target system information) Boot Project Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 In the Boot Project group box, you can set whether the boot project on the target system should be updated by default on download or online change. By activating or deactivating the checkbox in the login dialog, which is displayed when changes are made to the project (see Command Login [} 149]), the default setting defined here is overwritten once. Update Boot Project on During an online change, the boot project on the target system is updated by Online Change default. Update Boot Project on During a download, the boot project on the target system is updated by default. Download Target Behavior In the Target Behavior group box, you can set how the target system handles persistent data as well as pointers and references. Clear Invalid Persistent The backup of the stored persistent data is ignored. This ensures that any invalid Data data is not accepted but instead discarded. See: Backup of persistent data [} 117] Restore moved Pointers/ Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 References During an Online Change, the values of all PLC pointers are automatically updated so that the respective pointer refers to the same variable or the same object as before the Online Change. This means that a pointer remains valid after the Online Change, even if the variable it points to is moved to a different memory position during the Online Change. As updating the pointers takes time, deactivating this option speeds up the online change. In this case, the continued validity of the pointers is not guaranteed. You should therefore implement a mechanism for updating the pointers manually. See: POINTER Backup of persistent data Persistent data is regularly stored in a .bootdata file in the Twin CAT\Boot folder during a Twin CAT system stop/shutdown. At the next system startup (Twin CAT Run mode) this file is read, and the persistent variables in the runtime system are initialized with the values from the file. The system renames the .bootdata file to .bootdata-old. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 117

## Page 118

Reference User Interface This backup file (.bootdata-old) of the persistent data is read at system startup if the file (.bootdata) containing the persistent data does not exist. This is an exception, but it can occur, for example, if an IPC without UPS experiences a power failure and Twin CAT could not shut down properly. • If it is foreseeable that the contents of the backup file cannot be used at a new system startup, you can enable the option Clear Invalid Persistent Data to ignore the backup file. This can be the case, for example, if batch information or tool data has be stored in a production facility and has to be up-to- date. • If the structure of the persistent data (its data types or symbol paths in the program code) is changed due to online changes, it makes no sense to subsequently load an obsolete persistent data file. In this case, you should enable the Clear Invalid Persistent Data option in advance. In both cases, you should also ensure that a current persistent data file is available. Function blocks such as FB_Write Persistent Data (PLC Lib Tc2_Utilities) and UPS protection against sudden power failures are available for this purpose. When using persistent data, the corresponding flags (Boot Data Loaded and Old Boot Data) from the global structure Plc App System Info should always be evaluated (see documentation on System > Global Data Types).

Reference User Interface Name Symbol name (variable name, function block name, DUT name) (input field) Possible entries: • Selection of a declared symbol via the input assistant (button ) • Manual input of the symbol name. Trigger the search via the button or the [Enter] key. You can use the placeholders "*" (any number of characters) or "?" (exactly any character) in combination with a substring of a variable identifier for the text search. Use "%" if you want to search for IEC addresses. Examples: "%MW8", "%M*" Additional options from outside the view Cross Reference List: • Using the context menu command Find All References, if the name of a declared symbol is selected in an editor or the cursor is in the name. • Automatically, if the name of a declared symbol is selected in an editor or the cursor is in the name. An automatic search is also possible if the object is selected in the project tree. Requirements: The Cross Reference List view is open and the Twin CAT option Automatically list selection in cross reference view, category Smart Coding, is activated. The following entries are valid: • Variable name, simple or qualified: e.g. "n Var", "MAIN.n Var" • Function block name: e.g. "MAIN", "FB_My FB" • DUT name: e.g. "ST_My STRUCT" • Strings in combination with placeholder "*" (any character) or "?" (exactly any character): Example: "n Var*" matches n Var1, n Var Glob2, n Var45 etc.. "n Var?" matches n Var1, n Var2, n Var X etc., but not n Var Glob2, n Var45 etc. • "%<IEC address>": Twin CAT searches for variables assigned to this address and direct memory accesses. Example: "%QB0", "%Q0 := 2" Upper/lower case and spaces at the beginning and end of the input string are ignored. Open input assistant to select a symbol.

Reference User Interface Symbol The locations for the symbols (variables, POUs, DUTs) are grouped according to their declaration. The declaration location forms the root node, the usage points in the project appear indented below it. The system displays the exact expression, which the symbol has at the point of use. Example: If there is a global variable "n Var" in the project and a locally declared variable "n Var" in a function block, then after a text search for the cross-references two root node entries appear in the list, and the respective point of use of variable "n Var" is shown below. Function block Function block name, DUT name; also task name in case of a function block call in the task configuration, for example. Variable Pure variable name. Example: "n Var". Access Type of access to the variable at the point of use: Declaration / Read / Write / Call. Special case for pointers: An assignment of the type p Sample := ADR(n Var1) is displayed as Write | Address when searching for "n Var1". Reason: Any write accesses to "p Sample" are not displayed when searching for "n Var1". Write accesses are also possible via the pointer variable. Context Context of the use of the variables. Example: "n Var := 1" Type Data type of the variable. Address IEC address, if assigned to the variable. Example "AT%QB0" Position Position of the usage location within the editor of the POU concerned: for example, line number, network number, declaration part, or implementation part. Example: "Line 1, column 1 (Impl)" or "Line 9 (Decl)". Object POU name + in square brackets the complete path of the point of use. Example: "MAIN [Twin CAT_Sample Project: PLC: Sample PLCProject]" Comment Comment, if present in the variable declaration. The search returns all locations in the project as well as in inserted, uncompiled libraries.

Call: Menu PLC > Window Callstack view This view is useful if you want to run programs step-by-step. It shows the currently reached position with the complete call path. 138 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

## Page 139

Reference User Interface Application Name of the active PLC project that controls the currently reached program block. Task Name of the task that controls the currently reached program block. POU Name of the program block in which the program execution is located. The first line in the list describes the current execution position. It is marked with a yellow arrow. If this position is in a function block called by another function block, the position of the call is described in the second line. If the caller is called by another function block, this call position is described in the third line and so on. Location Position within the program block where the program execution is located • Row and column number for text editors • Network or element number for graphical editors Instance path Instance in which the program is executed. The Call Stack is also available in offline mode and in normal online mode if you are not using any debugging functions. In this case, it contains the last position displayed during a step-by-step execution, but in "gray" font. In contrast to the Call Stack view, the Call Tree view provides call information on a function block at any time. See also: • PLC documentation: Use of breakpoints 5.8.1.8 Command Call Tree Symbol: Function: The command opens the Call Tree view. Call: Menu PLC > Window Call Tree view The Call Tree is available at any time before the application is compiled. It is a static representation of the callers and calls of the function block, which you can specify explicitly. This means that the tree always contains two root nodes, under which the respective call sequence is displayed as consecutive indented entries. Recursive calls are quickly recognizable in this tree view. Example of a Call Tree (1) for function block (2) MAIN: • (3) Node "<function block name> is called by:" TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 139

Display source code Twin CAT jumps to the point where the function block is used in the source code position of your program. Set as new root node The entry selected in the Call Tree appears in "function block name". The tree is automatically adapted for the new root nodes. In contrast to the static Call Tree, which always provides call information for a function block, the Call Stack view is intended for immediate information during the step-by-step processing of a program. The Call Stack always shows the complete call path of the currently reached position. 5.8.1.9 Command Online Change Memory Reserve Settings Function: The command opens the Online Change Memory Reserve view.

Reference User Interface 5.8.2 Core dump 5.8.2.1 Command Generate core dump Function: The command causes Twin CAT to first check whether a core dump file is already available on the target system. • If a core dump file is available on the target system, Twin CAT offers you to load this file into the project directory. There are three different ways to respond to the query as to whether the core dump file is to be loaded from the target system. ◦ Yes: If the core dump file of the target system matches the currently logged-in PLC project, Twin CAT loads the core dump file from the target system to the project directory. You can open this file by subsequently logging out the PLC project and using the Command Load core dump [} 143]. ◦ No: A new core dump file will be generated in the project directory. The prerequisite for this is that the PLC project is currently at a breakpoint or that an exception error has occurred. ◦ Cancel: The generation of a core dump file is aborted. • If no core dump file is available on the target system, Twin CAT initiates the generation of a new file with the current PLC project data in the project directory. The prerequisite for this is that the PLC project is currently at a breakpoint or that an exception error has occurred. The core dump file generated is saved directly in the PLC project directory: <PLC_project_name>.<PLC_project_GUID>.core Call: menu PLC > Core Dump Requirement: The PLC project is in online mode. Automatic generation of a core dump on the target system If the PLC project running on a target system is not currently logged into a development environment, the runtime system automatically generates a core dump on the target system in the event of an exception error. This file is located by default in the boot folder of the target system (by default under < TC3.1.4026.0: C:\Twin CAT\3.1\Boot\Plc; >=TC3.1.4026.0: C: \Program Data\Beckhoff\Twin CAT\3.1\Boot\Plc). If desired, the storage path of the automatic core dump creation can also be modified, see Error analysis with core dump for more information. The automatic loading of this core dump file from the target system to the local project directory is possible with the help of the command Generate core dump. It is also possible to copy the core dump file from the target system to the development computer. Displaying the dump using the command Load core dump [} 143] can thus be used for (subsequent) error analysis. Core dump can only be used with the associated compile info file If you archive or save a core dump file, please note that the associated project and associated compile info file (*.compileinfo file, which is stored, for example when creating the project, in the "_Compile Info" folder) must be present in order to load a core dump. If this is not the case, Twin CAT cannot use the dump later. Please also note here the setting options on the Settings tab [} 116]. With the help of the Core Dump setting, you can configure whether the core dump file, which may be located in the project directory, is to be saved together with the available compile info files in a Twin CAT file archive. See also: • PLC documentation: PLC project at runtime > Error analysis with core dump • Command Load core dump [} 143] 5.8.2.2 Command Load core dump Function: Twin CAT searches the project directory for core dump files.

Reference User Interface • If Twin CAT finds a core dump file in the project directory, you are asked whether you want to load this core dump or browse for a dump file. • If Twin CAT does not find a core dump file in the project directory, you can browse for another dump file. Loading into the project causes an online view of the PLC project to appear, with the state the PLC project had at the time when the core dump was created. You can view the variable values contained in it. The call tree is also available. Call: Menu PLC > Core dump Requirement: The application is in offline mode. The Core Dump view can only be closed again using the Command Close core dump [} 144] command. The Logout command is not effective in this view. Core dump can only be used with the associated compile info file If you archive or save a core dump file, please note that the associated project and associated compile info file (*.compileinfo file, which is stored, for example when creating the project, in the "_Compile Info" folder) must be present in order to load a core dump.

## Page 147

Reference User Interface During the download, all variables except persistent variables are reinitialized. The description of the Login command explains the possible situations when logging in and loading. If you try to load a PLC project while the same version of this project is already on the controller, the following message appears: "The program is unchanged. Application was not loaded". Twin CAT does not load the project onto the PLC. When loading, a log of the actions that have taken place (creating the code, carrying out initializations, etc.) is displayed in the Output view. In addition, information about memory areas, the size of the code, global data and allocated memory is displayed. For the sake of clarity, in contrast to online change, the changed function blocks are no longer listed. See also: • Command Login [} 149] 5.8.5 Command Online Change Function: The command is used to initiate an online change to the currently active PLC project. Twin CAT only reloads the modified parts of a PLC project that is already running on the controller into the controller. Call: PLC menu Requirement: The PLC project is in online mode. An online change is not possible after the Clean All and Clean commands. The cleanup process deletes the compile information (compile log) that is automatically saved each time code is generated, and which forms the basis for an online change. WARNING Damage to property and persons due to unexpected behavior of the machine or system An online change modifies the running application program and does not cause a restart. Depending on the machine being controlled, the machine or workpieces may be damaged or the health and life of people may be endangered. • Make sure that the new program code results in the desired behavior of the controlled system. Project-specific initializations When an online change is performed, the project-specific initializations (homing etc.) are not executed because the machine retains its status. For this reason, the new program code may not have the desired effect. Major changes in the download code If the online change causes significant changes in the download code (e.g. shifting of variables is required), a dialog provides information about the effects and allows you to cancel the online change. Fast online change For small changes (e.g. in the implementation section, with no shifting of variables required), a "fast online change" is performed. In this case, only the modified function block is compiled and reloaded. In particular, no initialization code is generated in this case. This also means that no code for initializing variables with the attribute 'init_on_onlchange' is generated. This usually has no effect, as the attribute is usually used to initialize variables with addresses. However, a fast online change does not result in variable address changes. To ensure the init_on_onlchange attribute is applied to the entire application code, disable fast online change for the PLC project using the no_fast_online_change compiler definition. To this end, insert the definition in the Compile category [} 98] of the PLC project properties. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 147

## Page 148

Reference User Interface The attribute 'init_on_onlchange' has no effect for individual FB variables The Attribute 'init_on_onlchange' only applies to global variables, program variables and local static variables of function blocks. To reinitialize a function block during an online change, the function block instance must be declared with the attribute. The attribute is not evaluated for a single variable in a function block. Pointer variables Pointers retain their value from the last cycle. If a pointer points to a variable that was resized by the online change and moved in the memory as a result, the pointer variable no longer returns the correct position of the variable. Make sure that pointers are reassigned in each cycle. During an online change with possibly unintended consequences, Twin CAT lists the changed interfaces, affected variables and all function blocks for which new code has been generated in the Details dialog box. If storage locations change, a dialog is displayed to indicate possible problems with pointers. See also: • PLC documentation: Programming a PLC project What prevents an online change? After certain Twin CAT actions an online change on a controller is no longer possible. After that, a download of the project is always required. A typical case are the actions Clean and Clean all, which delete the compilation information stored during the last download. But there are also "normal" editing actions that result in an online change not being possible the next time you log in. The following actions can prevent an online change: Check functions Activating or removing a check function (Check Bounds, Check Range, Check Div etc.). Changing the interface of a check function (including inserting or deleting local variables). Task configuration Changing the configuration settings. Project settings Category Compile [} 98]: Changing the compiler defines in the Settings section (replace constants) Category Advanced [} 108]: Allow objects with the same ID multiple times in one solution Function block Change of option External implementation properties Function block Changing the basic block of a function block (EXTENDS FB_Base), or inserting or deleting such a basic block. Changing the interface list (IMPLEMENTS I_Sample). Exception: Adding a new interface at the end of the list. Data type Changing the data type of a variable from one user-defined data type to another user-defined data type (e.g. from TON to TOF). Changing the data type from a user-defined data type to a basic data type (e.g. from TON to TIME). Note: As a workaround, always change the name of the variable at the same time as the data type. As a result, the variable is initialized as a new variable, and the old variable is removed. An online change is then possible.

Reference User Interface 5.8.6 Command Login Symbol: Function: This command connects the programming system (the selected PLC project) with the target system (controller) and thus establishes online operation. An instance of the PLC project is created on the target system and loaded. Call: PLC menu or Twin CAT PLC toolbar options or context menu of the PLC project object (<PLC project name>Project) in the Solution Explorer Requirement: The PLC project is error-free and the target system is in Run mode. Possible login situations: • The PLC project does not yet exist on the controller: You will be prompted to confirm the download. • The PLC project is already on the controller and has not been changed since the last download. Logging in takes place without further interaction with you. • The PLC project is already on the controller, but has been changed since the last download. You will be prompted to choose one of the following options: ◦ Login with Online Change (please refer to the notes in section "Command Online Change [} 147]") ◦ Login with download ◦ Login without changes At this point you can also update the boot project on the controller. • An unknown version of the PLC project is already on the controller. You will be asked whether Twin CAT should replace it. • A version of the PLC project is already running on the controller. You will be asked whether Twin CAT should nevertheless log in and overwrite the PLC program that is currently running. • The PLC program on the controller is currently stopped at a breakpoint. You have logged out and changed the program: Twin CAT warns you that, in the event of an online change or download, the PLC will be completely stopped. This happens even if there are several tasks and only one of them is affected by the breakpoint. Compiling the project before logging in If a PLC project has not been compiled since its last change, Twin CAT compiles the project before logging in. This operation corresponds to the command Compile in logged-out state. If errors occur during the compilation, a message dialog appears. The errors are displayed in the Error List view. You can then decide whether you want to log in without loading the program onto the controller. See also: • Command Build PLC project [} 120] Error on login If an error occurs while logging on to the controller, Twin CAT interrupts the loading process with an error message. The error dialog allows you to display the error details. If an exception error has occurred and the text *SOURCEPOSITION* is contained in the log message, you can use the command Display in Editor to display the relevant function in the editor. The cursor jumps to the line causing the error. Output of information on the loading process If Twin CAT loads the project onto the controller when logging in, the following information is displayed in the message window: • Generated code size • Size of global data • Resulting memory requirement on the controller TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 149

Reference User Interface All variables of the active PLC project are reset, with the exception of the PERSISTENT variables and the RETAIN variables. The situation is the same as when an application program that has just been loaded onto the controller ("cold start") is started. Breakpoints of the PLC program that were enabled before the active PLC project was reset are still enabled after execution of the command. Breakpoints that were previously disabled are still disabled after the command is executed. If you select the command while the program is stopping at a breakpoint, you will be asked whether the current cycle is to be terminated. Alternatively, Twin CAT carries out the reset immediately. However, not all runtime systems are able to perform a reset without terminating the current cycle. After the reset, you must start the PLC program with the Start command.

If you have not yet saved a mapping for a particular library, you must redefine the mapping each time you open an old project that includes this library. A mapping defines how a library reference looks like after conversion of the project to the current format. There are three options: • You retain the reference. This means that Twin CAT also converts the library into the current format (*.library) and installs it in the local library repository. • You replace a reference with another reference. This means that one of the installed libraries replaces the previously referenced library. • You delete the reference. This means that the converted project no longer integrates the library. 166 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

The requirement for this is from TC3.1 Build 4026 that "Write Line IDs" has the value TRUE. (Default setting: FALSE) Up to TC3.1 Build 4024, line IDs are required for breakpoint handling, for example, and ensure that the code lines can be assigned to machine code instructions. Sort by name • TRUE (default setting): The subelements of POUs (actions, methods, properties) are sorted by name and not by internal ID (see sample [} 186]). Write Line IDs Available from TC3.1 Build 4026 • TRUE: Line IDs are created and stored for POUs in new projects. (Default setting: FALSE) This setting is the global default setting. When a new PLC project is created, the value of this setting is transferred once to the local project setting. This can be found in the PLC project properties (Category Advanced [} 108]) and can be adapted there for each project. Write PLC Bookmarks Available from TC3.1 Build 4026 to File • TRUE: In new projects, the bookmarks are stored in a separate .bookmarks file in the project directory.

See also: • Command Insert branch right [} 194] • PLC documentation: Sequential Function Chart (SFC) • PLC documentation: SFC Editor • PLC documentation: SFC element Branch 5.11.7 Command Insert branch right Symbol: Function: The command adds a branch to the right of the currently selected position. Call: Menu SFC, context menu The type of the inserted branch depends on the selected element: • If the top-most element of the currently selected elements is a transition or an alternative branch, Twin CAT inserts an alternative branch. • If the top-most element of the currently selected element is a step, a macro, a jump or a parallel branch, Twin CAT adds a parallel branch with label Branch<x>, where x is a sequential number. You can edit this default label name. You can specify the label as the target of a jump. • If a common element of an existing branch is currently selected (horizontal line), Twin CAT adds the new branch at the far right as an additional branch. If an entire branch of an existing branch is currently selected, Twin CAT adds the new branch directly to the right of it as a new branch. Note that you can use the commands Alternative or Parallel to convert a branch to the respective other type. Example: Parallel branch The following diagram shows a newly inserted parallel branch, generated with Command Insert branch right, while step11 was selected. Twin CAT automatically inserts a step (Step2 in the example). Processing in online mode: If t2 returns TRUE, Twin CAT executes Step2 immediately after step11, before t3 is evaluated. In contrast to alternative branches, Twin CAT therefore executes both branches. 194 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

## Page 195

Reference User Interface Example: Alternative branch The following diagram shows a newly inserted alternative branch, generated with Command Insert branch right, while transition t4 was selected. Twin CAT automatically inserts a step (Step32 in the example), a preceding and a subsequent transition (t41, t42). Processing in online mode: If Step3 is active, Twin CAT evaluates the following transitions (t4, t41) from left to right. The first junction of the branch in which the first transition returns TRUE is executed. In contrast to parallel branching, only one junction is executed.

Call: Menu SFC, context menu Requirement: A step is selected. Twin CAT adds the action element to the right of the currently selected step element. If you have already assigned one or more actions to the step, they are displayed in a "action list", one below the other. The new action is then placed as follows: TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 195

## Page 196

Reference User Interface • As the first action of the step, i.e. at the top of the action list, if you have selected the step element. • Directly before, i.e. above the action, if you have selected one of the existing actions in the action list of the step. The left part of the action element contains the qualifier, by default N, in the right part you enter the action name. To do this, click in the box to get an editing frame.

You recognize the possible insertion positions by the plus symbol at the cursor when you drag the element over the implementation part. Call: Ladder menu; context menu Requirements: No box is selected. 5.14.10.1 Element: Network A network is the basic unit of an LD program. In the Ladder editor, the networks are arranged in a list below each other. Each network is provided with an incremented network number on the left side and can include the following: logical and arithmetic expressions, program/function/function block calls, jumps or return statements. You can provide each network with a title, comment or jump label. Network title: Double-click the first line at the top of a network to specify it. Network comment: Double-click the second line at the top of a network to specify it. Jump label: Double-click the third line at the top of a network to specify it. The jump label can then be specified as a target at the Jump [} 232] element. In the Twin CAT options, category Ladder [} 174] you define whether network title, network comment and separator lines between the individual networks are displayed in the editor. 5.14.11 Command Insert Contact Symbol: , in the editor Function: The command inserts a contact in the network, to the left of the selected element. When you drag the element from the toolbox to the implementation part, the plus symbol at the cursor helps you recognize the possible insertion positions. Call: Ladder menu; context menu Requirements: A line or a contact is selected. 5.14.11.1 Element: Contact A contact passes on the signal TRUE (ON) or FALSE (OFF) from left to right until the signal reaches a coil in the right side of the network. To this end, the contact is assigned a Boolean variable that contains the signal. To do this, replace the ??? placeholder above the contact with the name of a Boolean variable. You can arrange several contacts in series or in parallel. If two parallel contacts are used, only one of them has to have the value TRUE for ON to be passed to the right. If contacts are connected in series, all contacts must be set to TRUE for ON to be passed to the right from the last contact of the series. You can therefore use LD to program electrical parallel and series circuits. A negated contact passes the TRUE signal when the variable value is FALSE. You can use the Ladder → Negate command to enable or disable negation of an inserted contact. TE1000 Version: 2.14.1 231

Call: Context menu when the function block is selected in the PLC project tree. Requirement: The function block implements an interface that you have changed. For example, you have added another method to the interface. Applications When this command is executed, the automatically created methods or properties are assigned a pragma attribute, which provokes compilation errors or warnings. This provides supports in the sense that automatically created elements do not remain empty unintentionally. Whether an error or warning attribute is used depends on the application. Case 1: Situation: The function block for which the command Implement interfaces is executed is not derived from another function block. Consequence: When the command is executed, the interface elements are created in the function block without implementation ("stubs") and assigned a warning attribute (in the first line of the method/property declaration). The warnings generated during compilation alert you to the fact that these elements have been generated automatically and that you need to add the required implementation code. {warning 'add method/property implementation'} Procedure: Add the desired implementation code to the corresponding interface element (method or property). Then remove the warning attribute from the method or property declaration. 254 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

## Page 255

Reference User Interface Case 2: Situation: The function block for which the command Implement interfaces is executed is derived from another function block. The element (method or property) created when the command is executed in the derived function block is not provided by inheritance from the base function block (that is, the element does not exist under the base function block or a higher parent class). Consequence/procedure: see case 1. Case 3: Situation: The function block for which the command Implement interfaces is executed is derived from another function block. The element (method or property) created when the command is executed in the derived function block is already provided by inheritance from the base function block (that is, the element exists under the base function block or a higher parent class). Consequence: When the command is executed, the interface element is created in the derived function block without implementation ("stub") and assigned an error attribute (in the first line of the method/property declaration). The error generated during compilation alerts you to the fact that this interface element was generated automatically and that this method or property overwrites the corresponding element of the basic function block. {error 'add method/property implementation or delete method/property to use base implementation'} Procedure: If you want to overwrite or enhance the method or property of the basic function block, add the required implementation code to the element below the derived function block. Then remove the error attribute from the method or property declaration. However, if you do not want to overwrite the method or property of the basic function block, delete the method or property below the derived function block. In this case the method or property implementation of the basic function block is used. 5.21 Solution context menu 5.21.1 Command Build Solution Symbol: Function: This command starts the compilation process or the code generation for all projects contained in the solution.

The purpose of the folder is, for example, to archive the libraries used in a project within the scope of a project archive (you can configure whether this should be the case in the project settings, see Settings tab [} 116]). This allows you to distribute the project archive to a colleague, for example, and if the project uses libraries that do not exist in the colleague's local library repository, the missing libraries can be installed by using the command Install project libraries [} 260] or Install project libraries (unknown versions) [} 261]. Recently used libraries are added to the _Libraries folder at the following times: • when creating a file/email archive [} 50], if the file/e-mail archive is configured to contain libraries (see Settings tab [} 116]). • when activating the configuration [} 127] or activating the boot project [} 260], if the target archive is configured to contain libraries (see Settings tab [} 116]). • when executing the command Update project library folder [} 262].

## Page 265

Reference User Interface ◦ Login with Online Change (please refer to the notes in section "Command Online Change [} 147]") ◦ Login with download ◦ Login without changes At this point you can also update the boot project on the controller. • An unknown version of the PLC project is already on the controller. You will be asked whether Twin CAT should replace it. • A version of the PLC project is already running on the controller. You will be asked whether Twin CAT should nevertheless log in and overwrite the PLC program that is currently running. • The PLC program on the controller is currently stopped at a breakpoint. You have logged out and changed the program: Twin CAT warns you that, in the event of an online change or download, the PLC will be completely stopped. This happens even if there are several tasks and only one of them is affected by the breakpoint. Compiling the project before logging in If a PLC project has not been compiled since its last change, Twin CAT compiles the project before logging in. This operation corresponds to the command Compile in logged-out state. If errors occur during the compilation, a message dialog appears. The errors are displayed in the Error List view. You can then decide whether you want to log in without loading the program onto the controller. See also: • Command Build PLC project [} 265] Error on login If an error occurs while logging on to the controller, Twin CAT interrupts the loading process with an error message. The error dialog allows you to display the error details. If an exception error has occurred and the text *SOURCEPOSITION* is contained in the log message, you can use the command Display in Editor to display the relevant function in the editor. The cursor jumps to the line causing the error. Output of information on the loading process If Twin CAT loads the project onto the controller when logging in, the following information is displayed in the message window: • Generated code size • Size of global data • Resulting memory requirement on the controller • A list of the affected function blocks (for online change) In online mode, you cannot change the settings of devices or modules. To change device parameters, you must log the PLC project out. Depending on the bus system, there may, however, be some special parameters that you can change in online mode. Twin CAT stores the view configuration separately for online and offline mode. In addition, views that cannot be used in an operation mode are closed. For this reason, the view may change automatically when you log in. 5.24.2 Command Build PLC project Symbol: Function: This command starts the compilation process or the code generation for the currently active PLC project.

During the compilation, Twin CAT carries out a syntactic test of all objects used in the PLC project. The compilation procedure is always carried out automatically when you wish to log the project in with a changed program. After the check has been completed, Twin CAT displays any error messages or warnings in the Error List [} 83] view. Apart from that, the compilation information of the PLC project is created when building the project and saved in a local file (*.compileinfo) in the Solution. If the program was not changed since the last error-free compilation process, it is not recompiled. If the syntactic test is to be performed anyway, use the Command Rebuild a PLC project [} 266]. 5.24.3 Command Rebuild a PLC project Function: The command starts the compilation process or the code generation for the currently active PLC project, even if it was last compiled without error. Call: Build menu if a PLC project is currently selected, or context menu of the PLC project object (<PLC project name> Project) in the Solution Explorer Requirement: The PLC project is selected.

## Page 270

Reference User Interface The command opens the standard dialog for saving a file in the file system. The existing project name is offered automatically; it can be modified by the user, if required. When a project is saved as a library, there is a choice between two library file formats: • *.library (source library) ◦ You can open a source library (for viewing and/or editing) by using the Add Existing Item command, which is available on the PLC node within the project tree. ◦ You can "step" into a source library using the usual debugging function. • *.compiled-library (compiled library) ◦ This file extension can be used to save a library project in a compiled format. An encrypted image of the precompile context of the library is stored, which means the implementations of the library function blocks are no longer accessible or visible. ◦ A compiled library cannot be opened or debugged. ◦ Apart from this, *.compiled-library files behave like *.library files. You can therefore install and reference them in the same way. ◦ The source code of a library can be protected by using the compiled library format. In addition, the library files are smaller and the loading times are shorter. The code cannot be run through step by step The usual debugging functions cannot be applied to a compiled library (*.compiled-library). It is therefore not possible to jump into a library block of a *.compiled-library via debugging. 270 Version: 2.14.1 TE1000

Reference User Interface For a library project, a company, title and version must be entered in order to be able to install the library. Company Name of the company, which created this project (application or library). In addition to the library category, it is used for sorting in the library repository Title Project title Version Project version, e.g. "0.0.0.1" Released : Protection against modification enabled. Consequence: When you now edit the project, a prompt will appear asking you if you really want to change the project. If you answer this query once with Yes, the prompt will no longer appear when the project is edited again. Library Categories Categories of the library project by which you can sort in the Library Repository dialog. If no category is specified, the library is assigned the category "Other". To assign it to another category, the category must be defined. Library categories are defined in one or several external description files in XML format. To assign the library, you can either call such a file or another library file that has already picked up information about the categories from a description file. Requirement: The project is a library project. The Library Categories dialog opens, in which you can add library categories. Default namespace The default setting for the namespace of a library is the library title. Alternatively, a different namespace can be defined explicitly, either generally for the library in the project information during library generation, or in the Properties dialog of the library reference for local use of the library in a project. The namespace of the library must be used as prefix of the identifier, in order to enable unambiguous access to a module that exists more than once in the project, or if the use of this prefix is enforced by the library property Language Model Attribute "qualified-access-only" ("Unambiguous access to library modules or variables"). If you do not define a standard namespace here, the name of the library file is automatically used as the namespace. Placeholder At this point, a default name for the placeholder can be specified, which represents or references this library. If a placeholder is not specified explicitly at this point, the default setting for the placeholder name of a library corresponds to the library title.

Reference User Interface Generate tpy file Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 The tpy file contains, among other things, project, routing, compiler and target system information. It is the format used for describing a Twin CAT 2 PLC project. To ensure compatibility with existing applications, this file can be created for a Twin CAT 3 PLC project, if required. (Default): When the PLC project is created, no tpy file associated with the project is created. : When the PLC project is created, a tpy file associated with the project is created and stored in the project folder. Please note that the value and configuration availability of this option depends on whether or not the TPY file is configured as a target file (see Settings tab [} 116]). • If the TPY file is enabled as a target file, the following happens: ◦ Twin CAT remembers the current status of the "Generate tpy file" option (= "original value", see below.). ◦ If this is not already the case, the option "Generate tpy file" is automatically activated next time the project is created. ◦ In addition, the "Generate tpy file" option is grayed out so that it cannot be disabled by the user as long as the TPY file is configured as a target file. • If the TPY file is subsequently disabled as a target file, the following happens: ◦ Next time the project is created, the "Generate tpy file" option is assigned its "original value" (see above.). ◦ In addition, the option is no longer grayed out, making it available again for configuration by the user.

Reference User Interface Compiler Version Available up to Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 Defines the compiler version that Twin CAT uses during compilation and during loading for compilation. Please note that this setting does not replace the Remote Manager. For handling different engineering versions, if the PLC project is an application project, the Remote Manager should always be used. The compiler version should always be set to "latest" in this case. The compiler version setting is only relevant if the PLC project to be version- managed is a library project.. It is recommended that the library is saved with the oldest version with which it is ultimately to be used. To this end, the compiler version must be set to the corresponding fixed version (e.g. "3.1.4018.0"). Maximum number of Refers to the maximum number of warnings that Twin CAT issues in the Error warnings List view. The selection of displayed compiler warnings is defined in the category Compiler warnings in the Project Settings dialog. Replace constants : Twin CAT loads the value directly for each constant of scalar type, i.e. not for STRING, ARRAY or structures. In online mode, Twin CAT identifies the constants in the declaration editor or monitoring window with a symbol preceding the value. In this case, access via an ADR operator, forcing or writing, for example, is not possible. (Default): Access to constants is possible. The computing time increases slightly.

Reference User Interface Write object content as Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 ("Write object content Background information: as") From Build 4024, Base64 introduces a new storage format that is optionally available for the following PLC objects: • POUs where the POU body is programmed in a graphical implementation language ◦ Sequential Function Chart (SFC) ◦ FBD/LD/IL (Function Block Diagram/Ladder Diagram/Instruction List) ◦ CFC (Continuous Function Chart and page-oriented CFC) ◦ UML class diagram and state diagram • POUs with a subelement (e.g. action, method) that is programmed in a graphical implementation language (for graphical languages see first key point) • Visualizations • Visualization Manager • Text lists • Recipe manager • Image pool Up to now, these objects were saved as XML by default. From Build 4024 you can configure whether these object types should be saved as XML or Base64. Advantages of Base64 over XML: Base64 results in compressed storage, compared to XML. As a result, improved performance can be achieved with file access to these objects, which can be used, for example, when loading projects or moving/copying objects. Setting option for the standard storage format: For a PLC project, the setting "Write object content as" in the PLC project properties can be used to define the default storage format for the object types mentioned above. The selected standard storage format is only used with newly added objects (exception: not with newly added POU sub-objects. Example: A POU is saved as an XML and the standard storage format is configured as Base64. If a graphic sub-object is then added to the POU, the storage format of the POU and thus of the sub-object as XML remains unchanged). The storage format of an existing object with a non-standard storage format is not automatically changed when the object is changed and saved. The storage format of an existing object can be changed individually via the Properties window (see below). Alternatively, when changing the standard storage format, there is the option of adopting the newly selected storage format for all existing objects. If you change the storage format at this point, a corresponding query window appears. The following options are available for the setting "Write object content as": • XML (Default): The PLC objects mentioned above are saved in XML format by default. ◦ Objects with this storage format are stored in file version 1.1.0.1. • Base64: The PLC objects mentioned above are saved in Base64 format by default. ◦ Objects with this storage format are stored in file version 1.2.0.0. Please note that objects with the file version 1.2.0.0 (or higher) cannot be loaded with Engineering versions < Twin CAT 3.1.4024! Individual setting option of the storage format: The storage format of an object can be configured individually for the object types mentioned above in the Properties window of the object.

Reference User Interface Write product version in Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024 files The product version indicates which plug-in version was used to save a PLC file ("Write product version in (e.g. a function block). The setting of this checkbox is valid for the whole project files") and is the default setting for all modified or newly added PLC objects located in this PLC project. (Default): The product or plugin version is not written to the file. • If you change the setting from enabled to disabled, a query window appears in which you can select whether to remove the product version from all existing files. • Use case for the disabled option: This setting can be used if the product version is not of interest. This minimizes changes to files with regard to source code management systems. The product or plugin version is written into the file (the version is not visible in XAE; it shows up if the file is analyzed at file level). • If you change the setting from disabled to enabled, a query window appears in which you can select whether to add the product version to all existing files. • Use case for the enabled option: This setting can be used to include the file version in the file for debugging or tracking purposes, for example. • Note the following: If the file is saved with a different product version, this leads to a change of this file, which shows up as a file difference when using source code management systems. Write object content with The profile defines the format in which objects are saved. With Build 4024, for profile example, new functionalities were added for the PLC HMI. For this reason, visualization files saved with Build 4024 cannot be directly opened with older builds. If you set a 4022 profile here, then the visualization files will be saved in the appropriate format and can be opened with Build 4022. Requirement: So that, for example, the 4022 profile is available in the drop-down menu, either a 4022 Remote Manager installation must be carried out or the current 4024 XAE installation must have been installed via a previously existing 4022 XAE installation. Write Bookmarks to File Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 (Default): The bookmarks are only saved in the .suo file from Visual Studio. A .bookmarks file that has already been created is deleted from the project directory. : The stored bookmarks are also written from the Visual Studio project user options file (.suo) to a separate file. This file ends with .bookmarks and is located in the project directory. It is then also part of the known archive options. The global default setting for new PLC projects as to whether bookmarks should be stored in a separate file can be found at Dialog Options - Write Options [} 185].

When you open a PLC project that uses an outdated visualization profile, a warning appears in the message window ("New Version found for Visualization profile"). (Default): If the Autoupdate Visu Profile option is disabled, the visualization profile version is not changed automatically. By double-clicking on the warning "New Version found for Visualization profile", you can open the Profile Update dialog in which you can manually change the visualization profile version. : In such a case, the visualization profile version is automatically set to the latest version if the option Autoupdate Visu Profile is enabled. With such an automatic update of the visualization profile version, a corresponding warning is displayed in the message window (e.g. "Visualization profile set from' Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4020.10' to' Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4022.0'"). Autoupdate Uml Profile This option allows you to configure the automatic update behavior of the UML compiler version. If you open a PLC project, in which an outdated UML compiler version is used, a corresponding warning appears in the message window ("new version for UML found"). (Default): If the option Autoupdate Uml Profile is disabled, the UML compiler version is not changed automatically. Double-click on the warning "new version for UML found" to open the Profile Update dialog, in which you can change the UML compiler version manually. : In such a case, the UML compiler version is automatically set to the latest version if the option Autoupdate Uml Profile is enabled.

For the assignment of the machine code instructions and the breakpoint handling in this case the line number is used. Therefore, an online change is required for changes such as spaces or comments. : Line IDs are generated and stored for the POUs of the project (default behavior up to Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4024). The line IDs can be used to assign lines of code to machine code instructions, which is required for breakpoint handling, among other things. The global default setting for new PLC projects regarding the Write Line IDs can be found at Dialog Options - Write Options [} 185]. The value is transferred once to this local project setting when a new PLC project is created. Compatibility Convert PLC Project to Available from Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4026 previous Twin CAT In the dialog that opens you can select a Twin CAT version to which the PLC version project should be converted (Twin CAT 3.1 Build 4022 or 4024). After confirming the conversion with Convert, the project is closed and saved compatible with the selected version. Note that the project data will be changed during the conversion and settings and properties of later versions will be lost. Therefore, the conversion is not suitable for multiple switching between different versions. Write events to event log You can use the following two options to configure whether and what type of user events you want to log. The following are considered user events: • Login • Logout • Download • Online Change • Start PLC project • Stop PLC project • Single Cycle • Reset cold • Reset origin • Set a breakpoint • Remove breakpoint The events are sent to the Event Logger during runtime. In addition, the events are output in the message window (Error List) if the Event Logger option Output as Task Item is set to True.
