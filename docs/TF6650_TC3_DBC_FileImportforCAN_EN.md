Overview 2 Overview The TF6650 function enables DBC file formats (.dbc) to be read. The DBC data format is a CAN network description and enables the definition of attributes and the assignment of these attributes to the elements of the network. DBC files are text files containing, for example, scaling information for CAN data and signal definitions. The import and pre-processing of the data takes place via the TF6650 using the parameters stored in the DBC file. As an additional function, network nodes can be simulated according to the DBC file. For a hardware interface, the function uses the EL6751 CANopen master terminal or the M510 CAN optional interface with the Embedded PCs or the FC512x plug-in card. 8 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 9

Requirements 3 Requirements Software The TF6650 is contained in Twin CAT Version 3.1 Build 4024.12 or higher. No further installation is required. Hardware The function can only be used in conjunction with an EL6751-0000 with software version 16 (V1.14) or higher. When using the M510 CAN optional interface with the Embedded PCs or the FC512x, the version of the CCAT driver should be V1.29 or higher. TF6650 Version: 1.1 9

CAN-Layer2 nodes 5 CAN-Layer2 nodes The CAN device of the EL6731 or of the CCAT CAN master has an additional tab with the name Import DBC: CAN nodes (without CANopen Application Layer) can be created by importing DBC file. Parallel selection for CAN Queue and CAN Layer2 node: The creation of a CAN interface is also possible via this route, since the import dialog enables the parallel selection of messages for the CAN interface and for CAN Layer2 nodes. The assignment of the selection is illustrated by the colored background (green – CAN Layer2 node / blue – CAN Queue). CAN interface with the name of the DBC file: If no CAN interface has been created before the import, this takes place with the name of the loaded DBC file. 5.1 Structure of the imported nodes Nodes marked for import in the DBC file are inserted in the Twin CAT System Manager as CAN nodes. Messages are mapped as PDOs and signals as variables. TF6650 Version: 1.1 13
## Page 14

CAN-Layer2 nodes If messages with extended ID (29-bit) are imported, then the PDO contains a corresponding note. A comment with structure information from the DBC file is appended to the imported variables. The data types of the CAN node variables correspond to the specification by the DBC file: • signed / unsigned integer • Bit size The Motorola/Intel bit-counting method or the swapping of the bytes in the case of integers is observed. Messages are mapped as PDOs and signals as variables: 14 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 15

CAN-Layer2 nodes 5.2 Prepared DBC Signals The most significant extension in connection with the DBC file import is the additionally inserted TCOM module "Prepared DBC Signals" . This module performs the scaling given by the DBC format and the (de)multiplexing of the signals. 5.2.1 Structure (hierarchy) Parallel structure of the CAN nodes underneath the Prepared DBC Signals node: In parallel with the CAN nodes, the following are inserted in accordance with the structure of the DBC file underneath Prepared DBC Signals: nodes, messages and signals. 5.2.2 Scaling Parameters for scaling are added to each signal defined in the DBC file. These are • Factor • Offset • Minimum / Maximum. In this context the DBC format refers to raw and physical values. The raw values are always transmitted on the CAN bus. The Prepared DBC Signals module shows the physical values, while the CAN Layer2 nodes show the raw values Physical values and raw values are converted to each other in the following context: Equations for the scaling The physical values are limited to the specified range (Minimum/Maximum) after the calculation. 5.2.3 Data type conversion Due to the scaling performed by the Prepared BDC Signals module, it is necessary to adapt the data types of the signals so that accuracy is not lost when scaling. In principle, all signals in the Prepared BDC Signals module are of the data type DOUBLE (64-bit (double precision)). TF6650 Version: 1.1 15
## Page 16

CAN-Layer2 nodes In the case of signals having an integer factor and an integer limit value (Minimum/Maximum), the conversion to DOUBLE is dispensed with and an integer data type is used instead. The data type conversion performed by the import can be displayed for each signal on the import page and changed if desired. For the "Prepared DBC Signals" always exactly the data type is created that you select at Twin CAT Datatype. First confirm your selection with the button Write new Datatype, and then with Apply, so that the change is applied. The signal properties Twin CAT Datatype and Twin CAT Bit Size can be adapted prior to the import. If a different data type is set, a new Bit Size is ignored. 16 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 17

CAN-Layer2 nodes 5.2.4 Multiplexed data Multiplexed signals defined in the DBC file (see fig. Multiplexed Signals [} 29]) are accepted into the Prepared DBC Signals node as normal signals. The demultiplexing procedure is carried out as follows on arrival of the corresponding CAN message: • if the message contains multiplexed signals, the multiplexer of the message is evaluated and only the signals that the frame contains are copied according to the multiplexer. • Multiplex signals not contained in the frame are not updated The multiplexing procedure (when transmitting messages), is initiated by changing a multiplexed signal before transmitting the message: • If the signal that was changed is a multiplexed signal, the signal is copied to the corresponding position in the frame and the multiplexer signal is set to the multiplex value of this signal. • The CAN frame is sent. TF6650 Version: 1.1 17
## Page 18

CAN-Layer2 nodes 5.2.5 Further signal attributes The networks, nodes, messages and signals defined in a DBC file can possess additional attributes. Some of these attributes are evaluated by the supplement during the import. These are: 18 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 19

CAN-Layer2 nodes Object type Attribute Application Network Protocol Type Bus Type The Prepared DBC Signals module additionally contains these variables: • Protocol Type = 1, the imported DBC file describes a J1939 network • Protocol Type = 0, the protocol is not defined in detail • Bus Type = 1, the bus described is a CAN bus • If Bus Type = 0, the bus type is not described in detail Message VFrame Format Used to distinguish between • standard CAN frames (11-bit ID) and • extended frames (29-bit ID) • as well as J1939PG messages. Gen Msg Delay Time Gen Msg Cycle Time Gen Msg Send Type If a message is marked as "cyclic", then the Gen Msg Cycle Time is adopted as the Event Time in the PDO settings. The frame is thus cyclically transmitted. The value of Gen Msg Delay Time is adopted as the Inhibit Time. Signal Gen Sig Start Value The value specified under Gen Sig Start Value is used as the starting value (default value) of the signal. TF6650 Version: 1.1 19
## Page 20

CAN-Layer2 nodes 5.2.6 Simulation of network nodes The Rx messages can also be imported in the case of nodes that are marked for simulation: As described under "Marking a node for simulation [} 29]", individual nodes of the DBC file can be marked for simulation. Nodes with this marking also import their messages listed under RX messages (if selected). Furthermore, a direction reversal of the inputs and outputs takes place. 5.2.7 Reimport If a change is necessary when selecting the message to be imported after the import of a DBC file, the DBC import dialog can be called again (see additional Import DBC tab of the CAN device). The dialog displays the last loaded DBC file. The markings set beforehand are likewise set. All messages are reimported on quitting the import dialog. Existing variable links are re-established. 5.2.8 Tolerating messages with data lengths exceeding 8 bytes ECU, messages and signals that exceed the 8-byte limit are marked with an exclamation mark: 20 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 21

CAN-Layer2 nodes In addition to messages that are defined by maximally 8 bytes of data, the DBC format also enables the definition of messages with data lengths exceeding 8 bytes. These cannot be transmitted with a CAN Frame. A transport protocol must be used for the transmission of such large messages (as are usual, for example, with the J1939 protocol). Such a high protocol is not implemented. However, such messages are read and marked with an exclamation mark. For a better overview, the ECU and the signals that exceed the 8-byte limit are also marked in the same way. 5.2.9 General notes CAN interface and CANopen nodes on a single CAN device are not supported. Conversely, the CAN interface and CAN Layer2 nodes are supported. If the CAN interface and CAN-Layer2 nodes are inserted under a CAN device, the CAN-Layer2 nodes always have priority when receiving CAN messages (even if the ID is set in the acceptance filters of the CAN queue). All other IDs that are also entered in the acceptance filter are routed to the CAN queue. Note on double-assigned CAN IDs: TF6650 Version: 1.1 21
## Page 22

CAN-Layer2 nodes An Extended ID in the range of the 11-bit ID (< 0x7FF) is not an 11-bit ID. This is therefore not received by the CAN Layer2 nodes. The CAN Queue, conversely, does not make this distinction, but instead displays this extended or standard ID in bit 31. Before the activation of the configuration, an additional check is performed to ascertain whether CAN IDs have been assigned twice. If so, this will be reported. 5.3 Necessary firmware version The support of the 29-bit ID for the PDOs is possible with the EL6751 from this firmware version: • FW16(V1.14) If an EL6751 is to be used that uses an older firmware, the following error message (Emergency) will be shown when activating the configuration: (COE-Emergency (Hex:ff00,02,“10 0607 0620“) ) PDOs with 11-bit identifier already function with older firmware versions. Twin CAT Version 4024.12 or higher is to be used when using the M510 CAN optional interface with the Embedded PCs or the FC512x. The version of the CCAT driver should be V1.29 or higher: 22 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 23

Monitoring messages with CCAT-based CAN interfaces 6 Monitoring messages with CCAT-based CAN interfaces If messages from a network device are sporadically not sent cyclically, it may be necessary to monitor the arrival of a message. The CCAT-CAN device offers the option here to perform monitoring with the Receive Counter in the IO tree. The Receive Counter is located in the DBC - RAW data underneath the associated message. If the message arrives, the counter is incremented. TF6650 Version: 1.1 23
## Page 24

Monitoring of messages with the EL6751 7 Monitoring of messages with the EL6751 The following settings need to be made in order to monitor the arrival of messages with the EL6751: 1. Switch the mapping of the terminal to MDP Mapping and select PDO Toggle 2. Activate the PDO-Toggle/PDO State option of the corresponding message with the RAW data ð The Boolean variable PDO-Toggle is appended to the configuration. PDO-Toggle always changes its state when the message has arrived at least once per Ether CAT cycle. 24 Version: 1.1 TF6650

CAN interface 8 CAN interface For simpler parameterization of the CAN filter with the CAN interface, the import of Message IDs from a DBC file is possible. CAN interface of a CX2500-M510 – CAN queue settings with DBC Import button 8.1 Acceptance of Message IDs from DBC files for the filter In the 11-bit (CAN2.0A) mode as well as in the 29-bit (CAN2.0B) mode of the CAN interface, Message IDs can be imported via the property page "CAN Queue Settings" under the Import from DBC File button. 8.2 Import tab The Import tab implements the selection of the DBC file to be imported as well as the display of the contents and the selection of the messages. In 11-bit mode of the queue, only messages with standard CAN IDs are displayed. In 29-bit mode, Extended CAN IDs are also shown. 26 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 27

CAN interface You can search for any text (sub-text) within the loaded DBC file via the Find what: field. The selection bar jumps to the line with the first match and to further matches if the search is repeated with the same search text. 8.2.1 Representation of the DBC contents On the Import tab, the nodes of the DBC file are displayed in the following hierarchy: • Node (ECU) ◦ Message TF6650 Version: 1.1 27
## Page 28

CAN interface Signal Level Symbol Meaning Structure of the text Node (ECU) Network device ECU: %Name of the node% Message CAN message transmitted by the Tx message: ID: %id% [(29-bit ID | associated node Multiplexed)] %Name of the message% [%(Comment)%] Signal Signal within the assigned CAN Signal: %Name of the signal% message [%(Comment)%] Further symbols: Rx message CAN message received from the Rx message: ID: %id% [(29-bit ID | associated node Multiplexed)] %Name of the message% [%(Comment)%] Signal Multiplexer switch signal Multiplexer signal: %Name of the signal% [%(Comment)%] (Multiplexer) Signal Multiplexed signal Multiplexed signal: (at value %Multiplexor%) (multiplexed) %Name of the signal% [%(Comment)%] Node Network device that can be ECU: %Name of the node% simulated. (simulated) *data placed in [ ] are only displayed if they apply or exist in the DBC file. 8.2.2 Selection of messages for import Only messages that are selected are imported when clicking the Apply button. The selection is made via the checkboxes in front of the message lines. 28 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 29

CAN interface The checkboxes in front of a node (ECU) (de)select all selectable node messages. A selected message is additionally marked with a blue background if it is intended to be imported into the CAN Queue. The Property Sheet can also be used to import CAN-Layer2 nodes, in which case the selected messages are marked with a green background (see below). The number of selected messages is displayed in the header. In the case of verbose comments for the messages and signals, the size of the Property Sheet can be adjusted for greater clarity (Resize). The selection can take place via the mouse and the keyboard (arrow keys and space bar). The queue messages can be displayed in filter mode, but not changed. In the case of the queue, the selection from last time remains saved as long as only the queue is deleted and not the device. 8.2.3 Multiplexed signals Messages containing multiplexed signals are marked with Multiplexed. In the case of a received message, the value of the multiplexer signal indicates which of the listed signals the message contains (see: (at value x)). 8.2.4 Marking a node for simulation So that a node can be simulated by the PLC, the messages that it sends must be imported as outputs. Messages that it receives must be imported as inputs. This corresponds precisely to the reverse direction of the standard case, if the configuration of the nodes is only imported for observation. In this standard case, messages that a node transmits in the network are imported as inputs. Messages that the node receives in the standard case are ignored (not imported), since they could be transmitted by any other node of the network and could thus be imported via this node. Simulate-ECU direction reversal (input to output) and enablement of the RX signals: A node is marked for simulation by right-clicking on it (context menu). Alternatively, the passive and active (simulation) radio buttons adjacent to the tree can be used to switch. This node is then marked accordingly with a different symbol. The Rx messages previously marked only for information can now also be selected for the import. TF6650 Version: 1.1 29
## Page 30

CAN interface 8.3 Manual parameterization of individual filters The receiving filter of the CAN interface can also be manually set or deleted after an import. Deleting filters Filters must first be marked in the list before they can be removed from it. A multiple selection is possible via keyboard or mouse (range selection). Finally, the Delete selected Filter button must be pressed to confirm the deletion. Adding filters Filters are appended via the Append new Filter button. 8.3.1 Filter selection Filters can be entered as band-pass filters , as band-stop filters or via a mask . Band-pass and band-stop filters are entered as ranges. 30 Version: 1.1 TF6650
## Page 31

CAN interface 8.3.2 The mask input The filter mask is used to define which bits of the CAN identifier are to be compared with the assigned filter. If a mask bit is not set, the corresponding bit of the CAN-Id is accepted irrespective of whether the filter code is 0 or 1. If a mask bit is set, the corresponding bit of the CAN-Id is compared with the value of the filter code. If both are the same, the message is accepted, if they differ the message is rejected. Sample 1) Only the message with the ID 0x1200 is to be accepted. Filter code and mask for acceptance of the ID 0x1200: All bits must be compared, all bits of the mask to 1 The filter code must be set to the desired ID Sample 2) Filter code and mask for acceptance of the range ID 0x1200 – ID 0x120F: The messages from 0x1200 to 0x120F are to be accepted: In order to permit a range, the bits of the mask that mark the range are not set. The filter code can be set to any desired ID within the range 8.3.3 Tabular illustration of the filter IDs and comments Tabular overview of the receiving filters: TF6650 Version: 1.1 31
