Overview 1 Overview Task The "real-time loops" function allows the user to influence programmed loops within an NC program during machining. Effectiveness / possible applications Real-time loops can be used if the number of loops is not yet known when the NC program is created since the number is determined by process parameters such as the surface quality achieved. Compared to a programmed NC loop, the real-time loop offers the option of moving the loop endlessly in the backward direction immediately after entry. This function is available as of CNC Build V3.1.3105.01 Parameterisation In order to use the function, P-STUP-00033 [} 25], channel parameters P-CHAN-00406 [} 25] and P- CHAN-00407 [} 25] must be parameterised for the use of real-time cycles. Programming The frame of the real-time loops is programmed by the commands #RT WHILE [} 18] and #RT ENDWHILE. The condition is programmed by a real-time cycle [} 18]. Mandatory note on references to other documents For the sake of clarity, links to other documents and parameters are abbreviated, e.g. [PROG] for the Programming Manual or P-AXIS-00001 for an axis parameter. For technical reasons, these links only function in the Online Help (HTML5, CHM) but not in pdf files since pdfs do not support cross-linking. 8 Version: 1.14 TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Real-time loops

Description 2 Description Real-time loops allow you to influence the number of loop passes in the NC program during machining. Fig. 1: Overview A real-time signal can be used to determine whether to remain in a loop or to exit it at the end of a loop pass. %Rt Loop N010 X0 Y0 Z0 ;-loop : as long as ; V. RTG. LOOP. ENABLED = TRUE N020 #RT WHILE N040 X100 N050 Y100 N060 X0 N070 Y0 N090 #RT ENDWHILE ;------------ N100 X-20 Y-20 Z30 N110 M30 If the real-time variable is not set, the loop is skipped. It is also possible to program several real-time loops in succession. TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 9 Real-time loops
## Page 10

Description Fig. 2: Succession of real-time loops Definition and behaviour of real-time loops When programming a real-time loop in the NC program, make absolutely sure that the position in the plane when entering the loop is identical to the position at the end of the loop. The start point and end point of the contour within a real-time loop must be identical. In case of deviations, error ID 50991 is output. Within the loop you can use the "Backward motion on the path" or "Delete distance to go” functions. Real-time loops are not permitted with tool radius compensation is active. Error ID 22158 is output. Behaviours with backward motion on the path With motion backward on the path combined with real-time loops, it is possible to move backward immediately after entering the loop. 10 Version: 1.14 TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Real-time loops
## Page 11

Description Fig. 3: Direct backward motion immediately after loop entry It is also possible to enter a loop backwards in an NC program and to complete the loop in the backward direction. The loop can also be exited backwards by setting the real-time variable. Fig. 4: Existing the loop backwards TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 11 Real-time loops

Description Behaviour for deleting distance to go The “Delete distance to go” control unit can delete the distance to go for a single block in the real-time loop-. Fig. 5: Delete distance to go for a single block The function can also be used in the backward direction. The restrictions regarding backward motion in combination with delete distance to go apply.

Description 2.2 Differences from default loop Number of loop passes Default loops usually have a fixed number of loop passes. Real-time loops are endless running loops that are terminated by the variable V. RTG. LOOP. ENABLED. They have no fixed number of loop passes. Motion stop With default loops with synchronous variables (e.g. V. E. variable) as loop condition, there is always a motion stop at the loop transition since the current value of the variable must first be determined in the channel. Real-time loops do not have a motion stop at the loop transition, although the condition is evaluated in real time. Number of loop passes backward direction A default loop can only be move backward as many times as it previously moved forward. A real-time loop can move backward immediately any number of times until the loop is terminated by the variable V. RTG. LOOP. ENABLED. TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 15 Real-time loops

Description 2.3 Combination of functions “Insert motion stops during processing” and real-time loops When combining the "Insert motion stops during machining" function with "Distance" mode and the real-time loops function when using the "MODULO" option, the following special features must be considered: • An absolute commanded stop is only possible within the current loop or after exiting the loop. • A relative one-time stop in a future loop that is not reached by a premature exit is rejected. Absolute commanded stop Fig. 8: Absolute commanded stop Relative one-time/iterative commanded stop Fig. 9: Relative commanded stop 16 Version: 1.14 TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Real-time loops

Programming 3 Programming The loop condition is coupled to the real-time variable V. RTG. LOOP. ENABLED [} 22]. The real-time loop is programmed by the following command. Syntax: #RT WHILE [ [MODULO] ] #RT ENDWHILE MODULO (optional) at the end of the loop, the “dist_prog_start” [} 27] function is reset to the start value of the real-time loop. If this parameter is not programmed, this variable is continuously incremented. See Comparison chart in display data [} 13]. The loop condition is programmed using the syntax of the real-time cycles. Syntax: #RT CYCLE [DEF] [[ ID =.. ] SCOPE =.. END_ACTION =..] ;…Instructions #RT CYCLE END DEF Realtime cycle is only defined but not started yet. ID=.. Unambiguous identifier of the realtime cycle, see Note. SCOPE For validity, see Validity. Permissible identifiers are BLOCK, PROG or GLOBAL. END_ACTION Behaviour at end of the real-time cycle, see Action at end. Permissible identifiers are MOVE_ABORT or MOVE_CONT. 18 Version: 1.14 TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Real-time loops

Programming Real-time loop with variable geometry This example shows a real-time loop which has a variable geometry due to the command #OPTIONAL EXECUTION ON/OFF [SIMULATE]. The geometry in #OPTIONAL EXECUTION ON/OFF [SIMULATE] can be enabled or disabled by the simulate_motion control unit during machining. It is also possible to enable other NC commands such as M functions with #OPTIONAL EXECUTION ON/OFF [SIMULATE]. %Rt Loop ; RT WHILE condition N0010 #RT CYCLE DELETE [ID = 4711 ] N0020 #RT CYCLE [ID=4711 SCOPE = GLOBAL] N0030 $IF V.

Programming 3.1 Permissible NC commands within a real-time loop Only the following NC commands are permitted within a real-time loop. • Motion blocks G00, G01, G02, G03 • #SIGNAL SYN / #WAIT SYN • Write an external variable V. E. = • #OPTIONAL EXECUTION [ SIMULATE ] • #CHANNEL SET [ FAST_FORWARD_IN_CENTER= ] • #SPLINE ON/OFF • #STOP REVERSIBLE No spline mechanism may be active when #RT WHILE/ #RT ENDWHILE is pro- grammed. If the spline mechanism is active, #RT WHILE [} 18] will result in error with ID 22128; #RT ENDWHILE [} 18] will result in error with ID 22129. Only the NC commands listed are permissible. Error ID 22073 is output if other NC commands are programmed. TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 21 Real-time loops

Programming 3.2 Real-time variables for real-time loops The following real-time variables are available for the real-time loop: • V. RTG. LOOP. ENABLED - loop condition for a real-time loop • V. RTG. LOOP. COUNT – number of executed real-time loops 22 Version: 1.14 TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Real-time loops

Programming 3.3 Contour look-ahead and real-time loops There are two programming options to obtain contour elements in a real-time loop (#RT WHILE/ ENDWHILE [} 18]) in Mode 1: 1. Only one geometry is provided when programming #CONTOUR LOOKAHEAD LOG ON/OFF within a real-time loop [} 8]. It has the properties of the entry loop, which means the parameter "tangent_vari- ation" has the angle to the motion block before the loop. 2. If #CONTOUR LOOKAHEAD LOG ON/OFF is programmed outside the real-time loop [} 8], the ele- ments are supplied three times to obtain all the properties of the possible transitions. The transitions are: ◦ start of loop ◦ loop-loop ◦ end of loop NOTICE Do not program the NC command #CONTOUR LOOKAHEAD CLEAR within a real-time loop. If the command is programmed within the real-time loop, error ID 22073 is output. Behaviour of contour look-ahead within a real-time loop In this programming example, the contour look-ahead function is programmed within a real-time loop. The contour of the motion blocks 80 - 120 is logged once. N060 #RT WHILE N070 #CONTOUR LOOKAHEAD LOG ON [PARAM=1] N080 G1 X4 Y4 … N120 G1 X0 Y0 N130 #CONTOUR LOOKAHEAD LOG ON [PARAM=8] N140 #RT ENDWHILE Behaviour of contour look-ahead outside a real-time loop In this programming example, the contour look-ahead is programmed outside a real-time loop. The contour of the motion blocks 80 to 120 is logged three times. N060 #CONTOUR LOOKAHEAD LOG ON [PARAM=1] N070 #RT WHILE N080 G1 X4 Y4 … N120 G1 X0 Y0 N130 #RT ENDWHILE N140 #CONTOUR LOOKAHEAD LOG ON [PARAM=8] TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 23 Real-time loops

Parameter 4.2 Description Start-up parameters P-STUP-00033 Memory size for backward motion Description This parameter defines the memory size in bytes used for backward motion on the path. During start-up, the NC checks whether the required minimum size is available. If this is not the case, a warning is output and the memory size is set to the required minimum value. If the size is set to 0, the “forward/ backward motion on the path” function is not available. The maximum size is only limited by the resources available on the PC. Parameter fb_storage_size[i] where i = 0 to 11 (maximum number of channels: 12, application-specific) Data type UNS32 Data range 0 ... MAX(UNS32) Dimension ---- Default value 0 Remarks Channel parameters P-CHAN-00406 Activating real-time cycles Description This parameter enables the real-time cycle function in the NC channel. The controller must be restarted to adopt the change. Example: configuration.rt_cycles.enable 1 Parameter configuration.rt_cycles.enable Data type BOOLEAN Data range 0/1 Dimension ---- Default value 0 Remarks This parameter is available as of CNC Build V3.1.3107.10 or higher. Use of the parameter “rt_cycles.enable“ rt_cycles.enable 1 (as of V3.1.3105) continues to be supported. P-CHAN-00407 Memory size for real-time cycles Description This parameter defines the size of the memory for real-time cycles. The size of the memory is specified in bytes. The controller must be restarted to adopt the change. Then the specified memory is also available for real-time cycles. Example: configuration.rt_cycles.memory 60000 Parameter configuration.rt_cycles.memory Data type UNS32 Data range 0 ... MAX(UNS32) - 1 Dimension ---- Default value 48000 Remarks Note: The assignment of P-CHAN-00407 is only necessary if the memory set by default is no longer sufficient due to activation of the real-time cycles (P-CHAN-00406 [} 25]). This parameter is available as of CNC Build V3.1.3107.10 or higher. TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Version: 1.14 25 Real-time loops
## Page 26

Parameter Use of the parameter “rt_cycles.memory“ rt_cycles.memory 60000 (as of V3.1.3105) continues to be supported. P-CHAN-00425 Max. execution time of realtime cycles per CNC cycle Description This parameter defines the maximum execution time of realtime cycles in the NC channel. The parameter is specified in percent (%) and refers to the length of the CNC cycle. Example: If the realtime task of the CNC is clocked at 2ms and parameter P-CHAN-00425 is 75, the realtime cycles may require a total execution time of maximum 1.5ms. If this time is exceeded, error ID 50939 is output. Parameter rt_cycles.max_duration Data type UNS16 Data range 0 < P-CHAN-00425 < MAX_UNS16 Dimension % Default value 75 Remarks The user has no restrictions regarding the number of instructions within a realtime cycle. Realtime timeouts will occur if realtime cycles contain too many instructions and cannot be executed in one CNC cycle, The parameters P-CHAN-00426 and P-CHAN-00427 represent a safety mechanism to prevent such realtime timeouts as early as possible. P-CHAN-00426 Number of elementary instructions for time check Description This parameter defines the number of elementary instructions after which another time check is executed. A check for the execution time of realtime cycles must be made within a CNC cycle to see whether the permitted execution time is already exceeded. This takes place by checking the expired time after a specific number of elementary instructions in a cycle. Parameter P-CHAN-00426 indicates the number of these elementary instructions. Parameter rt_cycles.cont_steps Data type UNS32 Data range 0 < P-CHAN-00426 < MAX_UNS32 Dimension ---- Default value 100 Remarks The user has no restrictions regarding the number of instructions within a realtime cycle. Realtime timeouts will occur if realtime cycles contain too many instructions and cannot be executed in one CNC cycle, The parameters P-CHAN-00425 and P-CHAN-00427 represent a safety mechanism to prevent such realtime timeouts as early as possible. External variables P-EXTV-00005 Synchronisation type of external variable Description Write/read access is normally performed synchronously with processing. In individual cases, this implicit synchronisation can be suppressed (see Access synchronisation by NC channel). If the variable is a variable structure, all subordinated structure elements inherit the synchronisation type. In addition, the synchronisation type can be individually defined for each structure element in the type definition (P-EXTV-00018). Parameter var[i].synchronisation Data type BOOLEAN 26 Version: 1.14 TF5261 | Twin CAT 3 CNC Real-time loops
## Page 27

Parameter Data range TRUE, FALSE Dimension ---- Default value TRUE Remarks Synchronous accesses always cause the decoder to stop during a read operation until the synchronous read value is available to the decoder. In addition, it is not permitted to read synchronous variables, e.g. with functions such as an enabled Tool radius compensation; the message is output with ID 20651. 4.3 PLC interface for display data Currently covered path in the NC program (PCS) Description Reads the current distance covered in the NC program since program start or since the last # DISTANCE PROG START CLEAR NC command. The calculation is based on the current position in the current NC block. Signal flow CNC → PLC ST path gp Ch[channel_idx]^.bahn_state.dist_prog_start Data type UDINT (* LREAL) Unit 0.1 µm Access PLC is reading Special features * As of CNC Build V3.1.3104.01 the data element is provided in LREAL forma. Line counter, NC program Description The datum indicates the NC program line which is the source of the command just processed by the interpolator. The value is derived from the number of NC program lines which the decoder has read since the NC program started. All the lines read the decoder are counted, i.e. repeatedly read lines, empty and comment lines. All commands to the interpolator resulting from decoding a NC program line are assigned to the associated line counter. Signal flow CNC → PLC ST path gp Ch[channel_idx]^.bahn_state.block_count_r Data type UDINT Access PLC is reading Numerator of the real-time loop Description The datum shows the number of passes of the real-time loop in which the current machining is located. If a loop transition is in a forward direction, the datum is incremented by 1 and it is decremented in a backward direction. If more loop passes were processed in the backward direction, a negative numeral is displayed. Signal flow CNC → PLC ST path gp Ch[channel_idx]^.bahn_state.rt_loop_count_r Data type DINT Access PLC reads Special feature Date available as of CNC Build V3.1.3105.01 and higher Real-time loop active Description The datum indicates whether current machining is located in a #RT WHILE - #RT ENDWHILE sequence.
